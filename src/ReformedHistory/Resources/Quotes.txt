### FREE WILL

If God’s prescience takes away the liberty of the creature, there is no such thing as a free action in the world (for there is nothing done but is foreknown by God, else we render God of a limited understanding)…
It was necessary, therefore, that Christ should suffer, that God might not be mistaken in his foreknowledge, or come short of his determinate decree. But did this take away the liberty of Christ in suffering? “Who offered himself up to God” (Eph. 5:2), that is, by a voluntary act, as well as designed to do it by a determinate counsel. It did infallibly secure the event, but did not annihilate the liberty of the action, either in Christ’s willingness to suffer, or the crime of the Jews that made him suffer. 
— Stephen Charnock


Section Helvetic Confession 9.4


God’s foreknowledge in itself is not a cause why things are, except as it is conjoined with his decree. For things do not therefore come to pass because God foreknew them; but because He decreed and willed them, therefore they come to pass…
The same decree of God, is the first and principal working cause of all things; it is also before all other causes, in order and time. 
This first and principal cause, however necessary it is in itself, does not take away freedom of will in election, nor the nature and property of second causes. It only brings them into a certain order; that is, it directs them to the determinate end, upon which the effects and events of things are as contingent or necessary as the nature of second causes. So Christ, according to his Father’s decree, died necessarily, Act 17.3; 7 yet willingly, [Joh 10.17-18]. And if we regard the temper [state] of Christ’s body, he might have prolonged his life — and therefore, in this respect, he may be said to have died contingently.

-William Perkins, ‘A Golden Chain’


God invites all indiscriminately to salvation through the Gospel, but the ingratitude of the world is the reason why this grace, which is equally offered to all, is enjoyed by few.

Reprobation is not a denial of sufficient grace, but a denial of such special grace as God knoweth would infallibly bring them to glory. 
Neither doth the decree of preterition shut any man under a necessity of sinning and being damned, but it permitteth men voluntarily and freely to run into damnable sins, and through their voluntary impenitency to incur eternal damnation.
—John Davenant 
Animadversions


Reprobation is not a decree necessarily excluding persons not-elect from all possible means of salvation; but a decree permitting such out of freedom of their own wills to neglect and abuse such means of their salvation…

### UNLIMITED ATONEMENT

“…no theologian of sound judgment from the Reformed Church wishes to deny a general intention or ordination concerning the salvation of each and every person by the death of Christ, on this condition, if he will believe.
For this intention or ordination of God is general, and clearly revealed in the Holy Scriptures; although the absolute and infrustratable intention of God concerning the gift of faith and eternal life for certain people is special and limited to the elect alone.”
—John Davenant 
Response to the French Reformed Churches


the promises of the Gospel make offer of the grace of Christ equally to all; and God, by the external call, invites all who are willing to accept of salvation.

God’s mercy appears in this: 
1. That he wills the salvation of all men. 
2. That he defers punishment, and invites all to repentance.
3. That he accommodates himself to our infirmity. 
4. That he redeems those who are called into his service. 
5. That he gave and delivered up to death his only begotten Son. 
6. That he promises and does all these things most freely out of his mercy. 
7. That he confers benefits upon his enemies, and such as are unworthy of his regard.

…seeing that men are created in the image of God and that their souls have been redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ, we must try in every way available to us to draw them to the knowledge of the gospel.
—John Calvin
Sermons on Acts 1-7, Sermon 41, Acts 7:5


We must make every effort to draw everybody to the knowledge of the gospel. For when we see people going to hell who have been created in the image of God and redeemed by the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, that must indeed stir us to do our duty and instruct them and treat them with all gentleness and kindness as we try to bear fruit this way.
—John Calvin


That it is not false that Christ died for all men as it regards his conditional will, that is, if they are willing to become partakers of his death through faith. For the death of Christ is set before all in the Gospel, and no one is excluded from it, but he who excludes himself.
—Girolamo Zanchi


The death of Christ is represented in Holy Scripture as a universal remedy applicable to each and every human being for salvation, according to God's ordination and the nature of the thing itself.

Christ offered himself on the cross for all men, as to the sufficiency of the price, but for the elect only as to its eficacy: because he brings salvation to the predestinate alone

“It is also a fact, without controversy, that Christ came to atone for the sins of the whole world.”

### IRRESTITIBLE GRACE

“Who is drawn, if he was already willing? And yet no man cometh, except he be willing. Wherefore he is by marvelous means drawn to be willing by him, which knoweth how to work inwardly, even in the very hearts of men: not that men should believe against their wills, which is impossible to be done; but that of unwilling they should be made willing.”
—St. Augustine of Hippo


God it is who draws to His Son those whom He calls; He does not compel them by force against their will, but He makes them willing from unwilling and by all sorts of ways overcomes the resistance of their unbelief.

### REGENERATION


LIMITED ATONEMENT

All people are under God's care; but he has a particular regard to his church. This is the signet on his hand, as a bracelet upon his arm; this is his garden, which he delights to dress; if he prunes it, it is to purge it; if he digs about his vine and wounds the branches, it is to make it more beautiful with new clusters, and restore it to a fruitful vigour.
—Stephen Charnock


### TOTAL DEPRAVITY
Let us leave to God his own defense. He does not need us to protect him from being considered cruel or unjust.
Let us believe the Scriptures, which proclaim in many places that we are born corrupt and tainted.

### UNCONDITIONAL ELECTION

Predestination is not anything in the predestined; but only in the person who predestines.
