### FREE WILL

If God’s prescience takes away the liberty of the creature, there is no such thing as a free action in the world (for 
there is nothing done but is foreknown by God, else we render God of a limited understanding)…
It was necessary, therefore, that Christ should suffer, that God might not be mistaken in his foreknowledge, or 
come short of his determinate decree. But did this take away the liberty of Christ in suffering? “Who offered himself
 up to God” (Eph. 5:2), that is, by a voluntary act, as well as designed to do it by a determinate counsel. It did 
 infallibly secure the event, but did not annihilate the liberty of the action, either in Christ’s willingness to 
 suffer, or the crime of the Jews that made him suffer. 
— Stephen Charnock


Section Helvetic Confession 9.4


God’s foreknowledge in itself is not a cause why things are, except as it is conjoined with his decree. For things do 
not therefore come to pass because God foreknew them; but because He decreed and willed them, therefore they come to 
pass... The same decree of God, is the first and principal working cause of all things; it is also before all other 
causes, in order and time. This first and principal cause, however necessary it is in itself, does not take away 
freedom of will in election, nor the nature and property of second causes. It only brings them into a certain 
order; that is, it directs them to the determinate end, upon which the effects and events of things are as contingent 
or necessary as the nature of second causes. So Christ, according to his Father’s decree, died necessarily, 
Act 17.3; 7 yet willingly, [Joh 10.17-18]. And if we regard the temper [state] of Christ’s body, he might have 
prolonged his life — and therefore, in this respect, he may be said to have died contingently.

-William Perkins, ‘A Golden Chain’

"The Lord died for all; but all are not partakers of redemption, through their own fault."
—Heinrich Bullinger


### UNLIMITED ATONEMENT

God’s mercy appears in this: 
1. That he wills the salvation of all men. 
2. That he defers punishment, and invites all to repentance.
3. That he accommodates himself to our infirmity. 
4. That he redeems those who are called into his service. 
5. That he gave and delivered up to death his only begotten Son. 
6. That he promises and does all these things most freely out of his mercy. 
7. That he confers benefits upon his enemies, and such as are unworthy of his regard.

### IRRESTITIBLE GRACE

“Who is drawn, if he was already willing? And yet no man cometh, except he be willing. Wherefore he is by marvelous means drawn to be willing by him, which knoweth how to work inwardly, even in the very hearts of men: not that men should believe against their wills, which is impossible to be done; but that of unwilling they should be made willing.”
—St. Augustine of Hippo


God it is who draws to His Son those whom He calls; He does not compel them by force against their will, but He makes them willing from unwilling and by all sorts of ways overcomes the resistance of their unbelief.
—St. Prosper of Aquitaine

### REGENERATION


LIMITED ATONEMENT

All people are under God's care; but he has a particular regard to his church. This is the signet on his hand, as a bracelet upon his arm; this is his garden, which he delights to dress; if he prunes it, it is to purge it; if he digs about his vine and wounds the branches, it is to make it more beautiful with new clusters, and restore it to a fruitful vigour.
—Stephen Charnock


### TOTAL DEPRAVITY
Let us leave to God his own defense. He does not need us to protect him from being considered cruel or unjust.
Let us believe the Scriptures, which proclaim in many places that we are born corrupt and tainted.
—Peter Martyr Vermigli 
𝘖𝘯 𝘖𝘳𝘪𝘨𝘪𝘯𝘢𝘭 𝘚𝘪𝘯: 𝘝𝘰𝘭. 1


### UNCONDITIONAL ELECTION

Predestination is not anything in the predestined; but only in the person who predestines.
—St. Thomas Aquinas


“God elected believers; but He chose them that they might be so, not because they were already so.”
—Saint Augustine 
On the Predestination of the Saints
