THE LETTER OF THE HOLY SYNOD OF EPHESUS, TO THE SACRED SYNOD IN PAMPHYLIA CONCERNING EUSTATHIUS WHO HAD BEEN THEIR 
METROPOLITAN. 




THE LETTER OF THE SYNOD TO POPE CELESTINE.




DECREE OF THE SYNOD IN THE MATTER OF EUPREPIUS AND CYRIL. 

The petition of the most pious bishops Euprepius and Cyril, which is set forth in the papers they offered, is honest. 
Therefore from the holy canons and the external laws, which have from ancient custom the force of law,(1) let no
innovation be made in the cities of Europa, but according to the ancient custom they shall be governed by the bishops 
by whom they have been formerly governed. For since there never was a metropolitan who had power otherwise, so neither 
hereafter shall there be any departure from the ancient custom.
