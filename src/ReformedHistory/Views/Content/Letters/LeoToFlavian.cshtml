    <h3>Wherein Leo outlines orthodox Christology regarding Christ's two natures and one person</h3>
    <br />

    <h2>Eutyches Has Been Driven into His Error by Presumption and Ignorance</h2>
    Having read your letter, beloved, at the late arrival of which we are surprised, and having perused the detailed 
    account of the bishops' acts, we have at last found out what the scandal was which had arisen among you against 
    the purity of the Faith, and what before seemed concealed has now been unlocked and laid open to our view: from 
    which it is shown that Eutyches, who used to seem worthy of all respect in virtue of his priestly office, is very 
    unwary and exceedingly ignorant, so that it is even of him that the prophet has said: "he refused to understand so 
    as to do well, he thought upon iniquity in his bed" (Psalm 36:4).
    <br /><br />
    
    But what more iniquitous than to hold blasphemous opinions, 
    and not to give way to those who are wiser and more learned than ourself. Now into this unwisdom fall they who, 
    finding themselves hindered from knowing the truth by some obscurity, have recourse not to the prophets' 
    utterances, not to the Apostles' letters, nor to the injunctions of the Gospel but to their own selves, and thus 
    they stand out as masters of error because they were never disciples of truth. For what learning has he acquired 
    about the pages of the New and Old Testament, who has not even grasped the rudiments of the Creed? And that which, 
    throughout the world, is professed by the mouth of every one who is to be born again, is not yet taken in by the 
    heart of this old man.
    <br /><br />

    <h2 id="Part2">Concerning the Twofold Nativity and Nature of Christ</h2>
    Not knowing, therefore, what he was bound to think concerning the incarnation of the Word of God, and not wishing 
    to gain the light of knowledge by researches through the length and breadth of the Holy Scriptures, he might at 
    least have listened attentively to that general and uniform confession, whereby the whole body of the faithful 
    confess that they believe in God the Father Almighty, and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord, who was born 
    of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary, by which three statements the devices of almost all heretics are 
    overthrown.
    <br /><br />
    
    For not only is God believed to be both Almighty and the Father, but the Son is shown to be co-eternal 
    with Him, differing in nothing from the Father because He is God from God, Almighty from Almighty, and being 
    born from the Eternal one is co-eternal with Him; not later in point of time, not lower in power, not unlike in 
    glory, not divided in essence: but at the same time the only begotten of the eternal Father was born eternal of 
    the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary.
    <br /><br />
    
    And this nativity which took place in time took nothing from, and added 
    nothing to that divine and eternal birth, but expended itself wholly on the restoration of man who had been 
    deceived, in order that he might both vanquish death and overthrow by his strength, the Devil who possessed 
    the power of death. For we should not now be able to overcome the author of sin and death unless He took our nature 
    on Him and made it His own, whom neither sin could pollute nor death retain. Doubtless then, He was conceived of the 
    Holy Spirit within the womb of His Virgin Mother, who brought Him forth without the loss of her virginity, even as 
    she conceived Him without its loss.
    <br /><br />

    But if He could not draw a rightful understanding of the matter from this pure source of the Christian belief, 
    because He had darkened the brightness of the clear truth by a veil of blindness peculiar to Himself, he might have 
    submitted himself to the teaching of the Gospels. And when Matthew speaks of "the Book of the Generation of Jesus 
    Christ, the Son of David, the Son of Abraham" (Matthew 1:1), he might have also sought out the instruction afforded by the 
    statements of the Apostles. And reading in the Epistle to the Romans, "Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called an 
    Apostle, separated unto the Gospel of God, which He had promised before by His prophets in the Holy Scripture 
    concerning His Son, who was made unto Him of the seed of David after the flesh" (Romans 1:1-3), he might have bestowed a 
    loyal carefulness upon the pages of the prophets.
    <br /><br />
    
    And finding the promise of God who says to Abraham, "In thy seed 
    shall all nations be blest" (Genesis 12:3), to avoid all doubt as to the reference of this seed, he might have followed the 
    Apostle when He says, "To Abraham were the promises made and to his seed. He saith not and to seeds, as if in many, 
    but as in one, and to thy seed which is Christ" (Galatians 3:16). Isaiah's prophecy also he might have grasped by a closer 
    attention to what he says, "Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a Son and they shall call His name Immanuel" (Isaiah 7:14), 
    which is interpreted "God with us." And the same prophet's words he might have read faithfully: "A child is born 
    to us, a Son is given to us, whose power is upon His shoulder, and they shall call His name the Angel of the Great 
    Counsel, Wonderful, Counsellor, the Mighty God, the Prince of Peace, the Father of the age to come" (Isaiah 9:6).
    <br /><br />
    
    And then he 
    would not speak so erroneously as to say that the Word became flesh in such a way that Christ, born of the Virgin's 
    womb, had the form of man, but had not the reality of His mother's body. Or is it possible that he thought our 
    Lord Jesus Christ was not of our nature for this reason, that the angel, who was sent to the blessed Mary ever 
    Virgin, says, "The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee, and 
    therefore that Holy Thing also that shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God" (Luke 1:35), on the supposition 
    that as the conception of the virgin was a Divine act, the flesh of the conceived did not partake of the 
    conceiver's nature? But that birth so uniquely wondrous and so wondrously unique, is not to be understood in such 
    wise that the properties of His kind were removed through the novelty of His creation. For though the Holy Spirit 
    imparted fertility to the virgin, yet a real body was received from her body, and, "Wisdom building her a house" (Proverbs 9:1), 
    "the Word became flesh and dwelt in us" (John 1:14), that is, in that flesh which he took from man and which he quickened 
    with the breath of a higher life.
    <br /><br />

    <h2 id="Part3">The Faith and Counsel of God In Regard to the Incarnation of the Word are Set Forth</h2>
    Without detriment therefore to the properties of either nature and substance which then came together in one 
    person, majesty took on humility, strength weakness, eternity mortality; and for the paying off of the debt 
    belonging to our condition, inviolable nature was united with possible nature, so that, as suited the needs of our 
    case, one and the same Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus, could both die with the one and not 
    die with the other.
    <br /><br />
    
    Thus in the whole and perfect nature of true man was true God born, complete in what was His 
    own, complete in what was ours. And by "ours" we mean what the Creator formed in us from the beginning and what He 
    undertook to repair. For what the Deceiver brought in and deceived man committed, had no trace in the Saviour. Nor, 
    because He partook of man's weaknesses, did He therefore share our faults. He took the form of a slave (Philippians 2:6-7) without 
    stain of sin, increasing the human and not diminishing the divine: because that emptying of Himself whereby the 
    Invisible made Himself visible and, Creator and Lord of all things though He be, wished to be a mortal, was the 
    bending down of pity, not the failing of power.
    <br /><br />
    
    Accordingly, He who while remaining in the form of God made man, 
    was also made man in the form of a slave. For both natures retain their own proper character without loss: and as 
    the form of God did not do away with the form of a slave, so the form of a slave did not impair the form of God. 
    For inasmuch as the Devil used to boast that man had been cheated by his guile into losing the divine gifts, and 
    bereft of the boon of immortality had undergone sentence of death, and that he had found some solace in his 
    troubles from having a partner in delinquency, and that God also at the demand of the principle of justice had 
    changed His own purpose towards man whom He had created in such honour, there was need for the issue of a secret 
    counsel, that the unchangeable God whose will cannot be robbed of its own kindness, might carry out the first 
    design of His Fatherly care towards us by a more hidden mystery; and that man who had been driven into his 
    fault by the treacherous cunning of the devil might not perish contrary to the purpose of God.
    <br /><br />

    <h2 id="Part4">The Properties of the Twofold Nativity and Nature of Christ are Weighed One Against Another</h2>
    There enters then these lower parts of the world the Son of God, descending from His heavenly home and yet not 
    quitting His Father's glory, begotten in a new order by a new nativity. In a new order, because being invisible in 
    His own nature, He became visible in ours, and He whom nothing could contain was content to be contained. 
    Abiding before all time He began to be in time, the Lord of all things, He obscured His immeasurable majesty and 
    took on Him the form of a servant; being that God cannot suffer, He did not disdain to be man that can, and, 
    immortal as He is, to subject Himself to the laws of death.
    <br /><br />
    
    The Lord assumed His mother's nature without her 
    faultiness: nor in the Lord Jesus Christ, born of the Virgin's womb, does the wonderfulness of His birth make His 
    nature unlike ours. For He who is true God is also true man, and in this union there is no lie , since the 
    humility of manhood and the loftiness of the Godhead both meet there. For as God is not changed by the showing of 
    pity, so man is not swallowed up by dignity. For each form does what is proper to it with the co-operation of 
    the other; that is the Word performing what appertains to the Word, and the flesh carrying out what appertains 
    to the flesh.
    <br /><br />
    
    One of them sparkles with miracles, the other succumbs to injuries. And as the Word does not cease to 
    be on an equality with His Father's glory, so the flesh does not forego the nature of our race. For it must again 
    and again be repeated that one and the same is truly Son of God and truly son of man. God in that "in the beginning 
    was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" (John 1:1), man in that "the Word became flesh and dwelt in 
    us" (John 1:14). God in that "all things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made" (John 1:3), man in that "He was made of 
    a woman, made under law" (Galatians 4:4).
    <br /><br />
    
    The nativity of the flesh was the manifestation of human nature, the childbearing of a 
    virgin is the proof of Divine power. The infancy of a babe is shown in the humbleness of its cradle, the 
    greatness of the Most High is proclaimed by the angels' voices. He whom Herod treacherously endeavours to 
    destroy is like ourselves in our earliest stage, but He whom the Magi delight to worship on their knees is the 
    Lord of all. So too when He came to the baptism of John, His forerunner, lest He should not be known through the 
    veil of flesh which covered His Divinity, the Father's voice thundering from the sky, said, "This is My beloved 
    Son, in whom I am well pleased" (Matthew 3:17). And thus Him whom the devil's craftiness attacks as man, the ministries of 
    angels serve as God. To be hungry and thirsty, to be weary, and to sleep, is clearly human; but to satisfy 5,000 
    men with five loaves, and to bestow on the woman of Samaria living water, droughts of which can secure the drinker 
    from thirsting any more, to walk upon the surface of the sea with feet that do not sink, and to quell the risings 
    of the waves by rebuking the winds, is, without any doubt, Divine.
    <br /><br />
    
    Just as therefore, to pass over many other 
    instances, it is not part of the same nature to be moved to tears of pity for a dead friend, and when the stone 
    that closed the four-days' grave was removed, to raise that same friend to life with a voice of command; or, to 
    hang on the cross, and turning day to night, to make all the elements tremble. Or, to be pierced with nails, and 
    yet open the gates of paradise to the robber's faith, so it is not part of the same nature to say, "I and the 
    Father are one" (John 10:30), and to say, "the Father is greater than I" (John 14:28). For although in the Lord Jesus Christ God and man 
    is one person, yet the source of the degradation, which is shared by both, is one, and the source of the glory, 
    which is shared by both, is another. For His manhood, which is less than the Father, comes from our side. His 
    Godhead, which is equal to the Father, comes from the Father.
    <br /><br />

    <h2 id="Part5">Christ's Flesh is Proved Real from Scripture</h2>
    Therefore, in consequence of this unity of person which is to be understood in both natures, we read of the Son 
    of Man also descending from heaven, when the Son of God took flesh from the Virgin who bore Him. And again the Son 
    of God is said to have been crucified and buried, although it was not actually in His Divinity whereby the 
    Only-begotten is co-eternal and con-substantial with the Father, but in His weak human nature that He suffered 
    these things. And so it is that in the Creed also we all confess that the only-begotten Son of God was crucified 
    and buried, according to that saying of the Apostle: "for if they had known, they would never have crucified the 
    Lord of glory" (1 Corinthians 2:8).
    <br /><br />
    
    But when our Lord and Saviour Himself would instruct His disciples' faith by His questioning, 
    He said, "Whom do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?" And when they had put on record the various opinions of 
    other people, He said, "But ye, whom do ye say that I am? Me, that is, who am the Son of Man, and whom you see in 
    the form of a slave, and in true flesh, whom do ye say that I am? Whereupon blessed Peter, whose divinely inspired 
    confession was destined to profit all nations, said, "Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God" (Matthew 16:13-17). And not 
    undeservedly was he pronounced blessed by the Lord, drawing from the chief corner-stone the solidity of power 
    which his name also expresses; he, who, through the revelation of the Father, confessed Him to be at once Christ 
    and Son of God. The receiving of the one of these without the other was of no avail to salvation, and it 
    was equally perilous to have believed the Lord Jesus Christ to be either only God without man, or only man without 
    God.
    <br /><br />
    
    But after the Lord's resurrection (which, of course, was of His true body, because He was raised the same as 
    He had died and been buried), what else was effected by the forty days' delay than the cleansing of our faith's 
    purity from all darkness? For to that end He talked with His disciples, and dwelt and ate with them, He allowed 
    Himself to be handled with diligent and curious touch by those who were affected by doubt. He entered when the 
    doors were shut upon the Apostles, and by His breathing upon them gave them the Holy Spirit, and bestowing on 
    them the light of understanding, opened the secrets of the Holy Scriptures. So again He showed the wound in His 
    side, the marks of the nails, and all the signs of His quite recent suffering, saying, "See My hands and feet, that 
    it is I. Handle Me and see that a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see Me have" (Luke 25:39) in order that the 
    properties of His Divine and human nature might be acknowledged to remain still inseparable, and that we might know 
    the Word not to be different from the flesh, in such a sense as also to confess that the one Son of God is both the 
    Word and flesh.
    <br /><br />
    
    Of this mystery of the faith your opponent Eutyches must be reckoned to have but little sense 
    if he has recognized our nature in the Only-begotten of God neither through the humiliation of His having to die, 
    nor through the glory of His rising again. Nor has he any fear of the blessed apostle and evangelist John's 
    declaration when he says, "every spirit which confesses Jesus Christ to have come in the flesh is of God, and 
    every spirit which destroys Jesus is not of God, and this is Antichrist" (1 John 4:3). But what is "to destroy Jesus," except 
    to take away the human nature from Him, and to render void the mystery by which alone we were saved, by the most 
    barefaced fictions.
    <br /><br />
    
    The truth is that being in darkness about the nature of Christ's body, he must also be befooled 
    by the same blindness in the matter of His sufferings. For if he does not think the cross of the Lord fictitious, 
    and does not doubt that the punishment He underwent to save the world is likewise true, let him acknowledge the 
    flesh of Him whose death he already believes. Let him not disbelieve He was a man with a body like ours, since he 
    acknowledges Him to have been able to suffer, seeing that the denial of His true flesh is also the denial of His 
    bodily suffering. If therefore he receives the Christian faith, and does not turn away his ears from the preaching 
    of the Gospel, let him see what was the nature that hung pierced with nails on the wooden cross, and, when the 
    side of the Crucified was opened by the soldier's spear, let him understand whence it was that blood and water 
    flowed, that the Church of God might be watered from the font and from the cup.
    <br /><br />
    
    Let him hear also the blessed 
    Apostle Peter, proclaiming that the sanctification of the Spirit takes place through the sprinkling of Christ's 
    blood. And let him not read cursorily the same Apostle's words when he says, "Knowing that not with corruptible 
    things, such as silver and gold, have ye been redeemed from your vain manner of life which is part of your fathers' 
    tradition, but with the precious blood of Jesus Christ as of a lamb without spot and blemish" (1 Peter 1:18-19). Let him not 
    resist too the witness of the blessed Apostle John, who says, "and the blood of Jesus the Son of God cleanseth us 
    from all sin" (1 John 1:7).
    <br /><br />
    
    And again: "this is the victory which overcometh the world, our faith" (1 John 5:4) and "who is He that 
    overcometh the world save He that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God. This is He that came by water and blood, 
    Jesus Christ: not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that testifieth, because the Spirit 
    is the truth, because there are three that bear witness, the Spirit, the water and the blood, and the three are 
    one" (1 John 5:4-8). The Spirit, that is, of sanctification, and the blood of redemption, and the water of baptism: because the 
    three are one, and remain undivided, and none of them is separated from this connection. The catholic 
    church lives and progresses by this faith, so that in Christ Jesus neither the manhood without the true Godhead, nor 
    the Godhead without the true manhood, is believed in.
    <br /><br />

    <h2 id="Part6">The Wrong and Mischievous Concession of Eutyches</h2>
    But when during your cross-examination Eutyches replied and said, "I confess that our Lord had two natures before 
    the union but after the union I confess but one," I am surprised that so absurd and mistaken a statement of his 
    should not have been criticised and rebuked by his judges, and that an utterance which reaches the height of 
    stupidity and blasphemy should be allowed to pass as if nothing offensive had been heard. For the impiety of saying 
    that the Son of God was of two natures before His incarnation is only equalled by the iniquity of asserting that 
    there was but one nature in Him after "the Word became flesh."
    <br /><br />
    
    And to the end that Eutyches may not think this a 
    right or defensible opinion because it was not contradicted by any expression of yourselves, we warn you beloved 
    brother, to take anxious care that if ever through the inspiration of God's mercy the case is brought to a 
    satisfactory conclusion, his ignorant mind be purged from this pernicious idea as well as others. He was, indeed, 
    just beginning to beat a retreat from his erroneous conviction, as the order of proceedings shows, in so far as 
    when hemmed in by your remonstrances he agreed to say what he had not said before and to acquiesce in that belief 
    to which before he had been opposed.
    <br /><br />
    
    However, when he refused to give his consent to the anathematizing of his 
    blasphemous dogma, you understood, brother, that he abode by his treachery and deserved to receive a verdict of 
    condemnation. And yet, if he grieves over it faithfully and to good purpose, and, late though it be, acknowledges 
    how rightly the bishops' authority has been set in motion, or if with his own mouth and hand in your presence he 
    recants his wrong opinions, no mercy that is shown to him when penitent can be found at fault. Our 
    Lord, that true and "good shepherd" who laid down His life for His sheep and who came to save not lose men's 
    souls, wishes us to imitate His kindness, in order that while justice constrains us when we sin, mercy may 
    prevent our rejection when we have returned. For then at last is the true Faith most profitably defended when a 
    false belief is condemned even by the supporters of it.
    <br /><br />

    Now for the loyal and faithful execution of the whole matter, we have appointed to represent us our brothers 
    Julius, bishop and Renatus, priest, as well as my son Hilary, deacon. And with 
    them we have associated Dulcitius our notary, whose faith is well approved, being sure that the Divine help will be 
    given us, so that he who had erred may be saved when the wrongness of his view has been condemned. God keep you 
    safe, beloved brother.
