    <h2>Greetings</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
        To the most religious and beloved of God, fellow minister Nestorius, Cyril sends greeting in the Lord.
        I hear that some are rashly talking of the estimation in which I hold your holiness, and that this is frequently the
        case especially when meetings are held of those in authority.
    </p>
    <br />
    
    <p>
        And in so doing they mean to say
        something agreeable to you, but they speak senselessly, for they have suffered no injustice at my hands but have been
        exposed by me only to their profit; this man as an oppressor of the blind and needy, and that as one who wounded his
        mother with a sword. Another because he stole money, in collusion with his waiting maid, and had always
        laboured under the imputation of such like crimes as no one would wish even one of his bitterest enemies to be laden
        with. I take little reckoning of the words of such people, for the disciple is not above his Master, nor would I
        stretch the measure of my narrow brain above the Fathers, for no matter what path of life one pursues it is hardly
        possible to escape the smirching of the wicked, whose months are full of cursing and bitterness, and who at the last
        must give an account to the Judge of all.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Section2">The Incarnation</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
        But I return to the point which especially I had in mind. And now I urge you, as a brother in the Lord, to propose the
        word of teaching and the doctrine of the faith with all accuracy to the people, and to consider that the giving of
        scandal to one even of the least of those who believe in Christ, exposes a body to the unbearable indignation of God.
        And of how great diligence and skill there is need when the multitude of those grieved is so great, so that we may
        administer the healing word of truth to them that seek it. But this we shall accomplish most excellently if we shall
        turn over the words of the holy Fathers, and are zealous to obey their commands, proving ourselves, whether we be in
        the faith according to that which is written, and conform our thoughts to their upright and it-reprehensible teaching.
    </p>
    <br />
    
    <p>
        The holy and great Synod therefore says, that the only begotten Son, born according to nature of God the Father, very
        God of very God, Light of Light, by whom the Father made all things, came down, and was incarnate, and was made man,
        suffered, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven. These words and these decrees we ought to follow,
        considering what is meant by the Word of God being incarnate and made man. For we do not say that the nature of the
        Word was changed and became flesh, or that it was converted into a whole man consisting of soul and body, but rather
        that the Word having personally united flesh to himself animated by a rational soul, did in an ineffable and
        inconceivable manner become man. He was called the Son of Man, not merely as willing or being pleased to be so called,
        neither on account of taking to himself a person, but because the two natures being brought together in a true union,
        there is of both one Christ and one Son; for the difference of the natures is not taken away by the union, but rather
        the divinity and the humanity make perfect for us the one Lord Jesus Christ by their ineffable and inexpressible union.
    </p>
    <br />
    
    <p>
        So then he who had an existence before all ages and was born of the Father, is said to have been born according to the
        flesh of a woman. But not as though his divine nature received its beginning of existence in the holy Virgin, for it
        needed not any second generation after that of the Father (for it would be absurd and foolish to say that he who
        existed before all ages, coeternal with the Father, needed any second beginning of existence), but since, for us and
        for our salvation, he personally united to himself a human body, and came forth of a woman. In this way he is said to
        be born after the flesh. For he was not born first as a common man of the holy Virgin, and then the Word came down and
        entered into him, but the union was made in the womb itself, and he is said to endure a birth after the flesh, ascribing
        to himself the birth of his own flesh.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Section3">The Two Natures of Christ</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
        On this account we say that he suffered and rose again; not as if God the Word
        suffered in his own nature either stripes, or the piercing of the nails, or any other wounds; for the Divine nature is
        incapable of suffering, inasmuch as it is incorporeal. But since that which had become his own body suffered in this
        way, he is also said to suffer for us; for he who is in himself incapable of suffering was in a suffering body. In
        the same manner also we conceive respecting his death, for the Word of God is by nature immortal and incorruptible,
        and life and life-giving. Since, however, his own body did, as Paul says, by the grace of God taste death for every
        man, he himself is said to have suffered death for us, not as if he had any experience of death in his own nature (for
        it would be madness to say or think this), but because, as I have just said, his flesh tasted death. In like manner
        his flesh being raised again, it is spoken of as his resurrection, not as if he had fallen into corruption (God
        forbid), but because his own body was raised again.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Section4">The One Person of Christ</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
        We, therefore, confess one Christ and Lord, not as worshipping a
        man with the Word (lest this expression "with the Word" should suggest to the mind the idea of division), but
        worshipping him as one and the same. The body of the Word, with which he sits with the Father, is not
        separated from the Word himself as if two sons were sitting with him, but is one by the union with the flesh. If,
        however, we reject the personal union as impossible or unbecoming, we fall into the error of speaking of two sons, for
        it will be necessary to distinguish, and to say that he who was properly man was honoured with the title of
        Son, and that he who is properly the Word of God has by nature both the name and the reality of Sonship. We must not,
        therefore, divide the one Lord Jesus Christ into two Sons.
    </p>
    <br />
    
    <p>
        Neither will it at all avail to a sound faith to hold, as
        some do, a union of persons; for the Scripture has not said that the Word united to himself the person of man, but
        that he was made flesh. This expression, however, "the Word was made flesh," can mean nothing else but that he partook
        of flesh and blood like to us. He made our body his own, and came forth man from a woman, not casting off his
        existence as God or his generation from God the Father, but even in taking to himself flesh remaining what he was.
        This the declaration of the correct faith proclaims everywhere.
    </p>
    <br />
    
    <p>
        This was the sentiment of the holy Fathers;
        therefore they ventured to call the holy Virgin the Mother of God, not as if the nature of the Word or his divinity
        had its beginning from the holy Virgin, but because of her was born that holy body with a rational soul to which
        the Word was personally united and born according to the flesh. These things, therefore, I now write
        unto you for the love of Christ, beseeching you as a brother, and testifying to you before Christ and the elect
        angels, that you would both think and teach these things with us, and that the peace of the Churches may be preserved
        and the bond of concord and love continue unbroken amongst the Priests of God.
