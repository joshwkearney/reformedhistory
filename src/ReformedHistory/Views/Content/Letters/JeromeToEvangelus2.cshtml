    <h2>Presbyters Are The Same as Bishops, And Over Deacons</h2> 
    <p>
        We read in Isaiah the words, "the fool will speak folly," (Isaiah 32:6) and I am told that someone has been mad enough to put
        deacons before presbyters, that is, before bishops. For when the apostle clearly teaches that presbyters are the same
        as bishops, must not a mere server of tables and of widows (Acts 6:1-2) be insane to set himself up arrogantly over men through
        whose prayers the body and blood of Christ are produced?
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
        Do you ask for proof of what I say? Listen to this
        passage: "Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi
        with the bishops and deacons." (Philippians 1:1) Do you wish for another instance? In the Acts of the Apostles Paul thus speaks to
        the priests of a single church: "Take heed unto yourselves and to all the flock, in the which the Holy Ghost hath
        made you bishops, to feed the church of God which He purchased with His own blood" (Acts 20:28).
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Part2">There Are Many Presbyters Per Church</h2>
    <p>
        And lest any should in a spirit
        of contention argue that there must then have been more bishops than one in a single church, there is the following
        passage which clearly proves a bishop and a presbyter to be the same. Writing to Titus the apostle says: "For this
        cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain presbyters in
        every city, as I had appointed thee: if any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused
        of riot or unruly. For a bishop must be blameless as the steward of God" (Titus 1:5-7). And to Timothy he says: "Neglect not the
        gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery" (1 Timothy 4:14).
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
        Peter also says in his first epistle: "The presbyters which are among you I exhort, who am your fellow-presbyter and a
        witness of the sufferings of Christ and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed: feed the flock of
        Christ... taking the oversight thereof not by constraint but willingly, according unto God" (1 Peter 5:1-2). In the Greek the
        meaning is still plainer, for the word used is episkopountej, that is to say, overseeing, and this is the origin of
        the name overseer or bishop.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
        But perhaps the testimony of these great men seems to you insufficient. If so, then
        listen to the blast of the gospel trumpet, that son of thunder, the disciple whom Jesus loved and who reclining
        on the Saviour's breast drank in the waters of sound doctrine. One of his letters begins thus: "The presbyter unto the
        elect lady and her children whom I love in the truth" (2 John 1:1) and another thus: "The presbyter unto the well-beloved Gains
        whom I love in the truth" (3 John 1:1).
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Part3">Is One Presbyter Over The Rest?</h2>
    <p>
        When subsequently one presbyter was chosen to preside over the rest, this was done to
        remedy schism and to prevent each individual from rending the church of Christ by drawing it to himself. For even at
        Alexandria from the time of Mark the Evangelist until the episcopates of Heraclas and Dionysius the presbyters always
        named as bishop one of their own number chosen by themselves and set in a more exalted position, just as an army elects
        a general, or as deacons appoint one of themselves whom they know to be diligent and call him archdeacon.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
        For what
        function, excepting ordination, belongs to a bishop that does not also belong to a presbyter? It is not the case that
        there is one church at Rome and another in all the world beside? Gaul and Britain, Africa and Persia, India and the
        East worship one Christ and observe one rule of truth. If you ask for authority, the world outweighs its capital.
        Wherever there is a bishop, whether it be at Rome or at Engubium, whether it be at Constantinople or at Rhegium,
        whether it be at Alexandria or at Zoan, his dignity is one and his priesthood is one. Neither the command of wealth nor
        the lowliness of poverty makes him more a bishop or less a bishop. All alike are successors of the apostles.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Part4">The Practices of Rome</h2>
    <p>
        But you will say, how comes it then that at Rome a presbyter is only ordained on the recommendation of a deacon?
        To which I reply as follows. Why do you bring forward a custom which exists in one city only? Why do you oppose to the
        laws of the Church a paltry exception which has given rise to arrogance and pride? The rarer anything is the more it is
        sought after. In India pennyroyal is more costly than pepper. Their fewness makes deacons persons of consequence
        while presbyters are less thought of owing to their great numbers.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
        But even in the church of Rome the deacons stand
        while the presbyters seat themselves, although bad habits have by degrees so far crept in that I have seen a deacon, in
        the absence of the bishop, seat himself among the presbyters and at social gatherings give his blessing to them.
        Those who act thus must learn that they are wrong and must give heed to the apostles words: "it is not reason that we
        should leave the word of God and serve tables" (Acts 6:2). They must consider the reasons which led to the appointment of
        deacons at the beginning. They must read the Acts of the Apostles and bear in mind their true position.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Part5">Presbyters Are Over Deacons</h2>
    <p>
        Of the names presbyter and bishop the first denotes age, the second rank. In writing both to Titus and to Timothy the
        apostle speaks of the ordination of bishops and of deacons, but says not a word of the ordination of presbyters; for
        the fact is that the word bishops includes presbyters also.
    </p>
    <br />
    
    <p>
        Again when a man is promoted it is from a lower place to
        a higher. Either then a presbyter should be ordained a deacon, from the lesser office, that is, to the more important,
        to prove that a presbyter is inferior to a deacon; or if on the other hand it is the deacon that is ordained presbyter,
        this latter should recognize that, although he may be less highly paid than a deacon, he is superior to him in virtue
        of his priesthood.
    </p>
    <br />
    
    <p>
        In fact as if to tell us that the traditions handed down by the apostles were taken by them from the
        old testament, bishops, presbyters and deacons occupy in the church the same positions as those which were occupied by
        Aaron, his sons, and the Levites in the temple.
