            <h4>What is your only comfort in life and death?</h4>
            <p>
                That I am not my own (1), but belong with body and soul, both in life and in death (2), to my faithful 
                Saviour Jesus Christ (3). He has fully paid for all my sins with His precious blood (4), and has set me free 
                from all the power of the devil (5). He also preserves me in such a way (6) that without the will of my 
                heavenly Father not a hair can fall from my head (7); indeed, all things must work together for my 
                salvation (8). Therefore, by His Holy Spirit He also assures me of eternal life (9) and makes me heartily 
                willing and ready from now on to live for Him (10).

            <h4>What do you need to know in order to live and die in the joy of this comfort?</h4>
            <p>
                First, how great my sins and misery are (1); second, how I am delivered from all my sins and 
                misery (2); third, how I am to be thankful to God for such deliverance (3).

            <h4>From where do you know your sins and misery?</h4>
            <p>
                From the law of God (1).
            </p>
            <br />

        <li>
            <h4>What does God's law require of us?</h4>
            <p>
                Christ teaches us this in a summary in Matthew 22: You shall love the LORD your God with all your 
                heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind (1). This is the great and first commandment. 
                And a second is like it, You shall love your neighbour as yourself. On these two commandments 
                depend all the law and the prophets (2).

        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Can you keep all this perfectly?</h4>
            <p>
                No (1), I am inclined by nature to hate God and my neighbour (2).

        <li>
            <h4>Did God, then, create man so wicked and perverse?</h4>
            <p>
                No, on the contrary, God created man good (1) and in His image (2), that is, in true righteousness and 
                holiness (3), so that he might rightly know God His Creator (4), heartily love Him, and live with Him 
                in eternal blessedness to praise and glorify Him (5).

        <li>
            <h4>From where, then, did man's depraved nature come?</h4>
            <p>
                From the fall and disobedience of our first parents, Adam and Eve, in Paradise (1), for there our 
                nature became so corrupt (2) that we are all conceived and born in sin (3).
            </p>
            <br />

        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>But are we so corrupt that we are totally unable to do any good and inclined to all evil?</h4>
            <p>
                Yes (1), unless we are regenerated by the Spirit of God (2).
            </p>

            <br />
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Is God, then, not unjust by requiring in His law what man cannot do?</h4>
            <p>
                No, for God so created man that he was able to do it (1). But man, at the instigation of the devil (2),
                in deliberate disobedience (3) robbed himself and all his descendants of these gifts (4).
            </p>

            <br />
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Will God allow such disobedience and apostasy to go unpunished?</h4>
            <p>
                Certainly not. He is terribly displeased with our original sin as well as our actual sins. Therefore 
                He will punish them by a just judgment both now and eternally (1), as He has declared (2): Cursed be 
                every one who does not abide by all things written in the book of the law, and do them (3).

        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>But is God not also merciful?</h4>
            <p>
                God is indeed merciful (1), but He is also just (2). His justice requires that sin committed against 
                the most high majesty of God also be punished with the most severe, that is, with everlasting, 
                punishment of body and soul (3).

            <h4>
                Since, according to God's righteous judgment we deserve temporal and eternal punishment, how can we
                escape this punishment and be again received into favour?
            </h4>
            <p>
                God demands that His justice be satisfied (1). Therefore full payment must be made either by ourselves 
                or by another (2).

            <br />
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Can we ourselves make this payment?</h4>
            <p>
                Certainly not. On the contrary, we daily increase our debt (1).

        <li>
            <h4>Can any mere creature pay for us?</h4>
            <p>
                No. In the first place, God will not punish another creature for the sin which man has committed (1). 
                Furthermore, no mere creature can sustain the burden of God's eternal wrath against sin and deliver 
                others from it (2).

            <h4>What kind of mediator and deliverer must we seek?</h4>
            <p>
                One who is a true (1) and righteous (2) man, and yet more powerful than all creatures; that is, one 
                who is at the same time true God (3).
