            <h4>What is your only comfort in life and death?</h4>
            <p>
                That I am not my own (1), but belong with body and soul, both in life and in death (2), to my faithful
                Saviour Jesus Christ (3). He has fully paid for all my sins with His precious blood (4), and has set me free
                from all the power of the devil (5). He also preserves me in such a way (6) that without the will of my
                heavenly Father not a hair can fall from my head (7); indeed, all things must work together for my
                salvation (8). Therefore, by His Holy Spirit He also assures me of eternal life (9) and makes me heartily
                willing and ready from now on to live for Him (10).

            <h4>What do you need to know in order to live and die in the joy of this comfort?</h4>
            <p>
                First, how great my sins and misery are (1); second, how I am delivered from all my sins and
                misery (2); third, how I am to be thankful to God for such deliverance (3).

            <h4>From where do you know your sins and misery?</h4>
            <p>
                From the law of God (1).
            </p>
            <br />

        <li>
            <h4>What does God's law require of us?</h4>
            <p>
                Christ teaches us this in a summary in Matthew 22: You shall love the LORD your God with all your
                heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind (1). This is the great and first commandment.
                And a second is like it, You shall love your neighbour as yourself. On these two commandments
                depend all the law and the prophets (2).

        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Can you keep all this perfectly?</h4>
            <p>
                No (1), I am inclined by nature to hate God and my neighbour (2).

        <li>
            <h4>Did God, then, create man so wicked and perverse?</h4>
            <p>
                No, on the contrary, God created man good (1) and in His image (2), that is, in true righteousness and
                holiness (3), so that he might rightly know God His Creator (4), heartily love Him, and live with Him
                in eternal blessedness to praise and glorify Him (5).

        <li>
            <h4>From where, then, did man's depraved nature come?</h4>
            <p>
                From the fall and disobedience of our first parents, Adam and Eve, in Paradise (1), for there our
                nature became so corrupt (2) that we are all conceived and born in sin (3).

        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>But are we so corrupt that we are totally unable to do any good and inclined to all evil?</h4>
            <p>
                Yes (1), unless we are regenerated by the Spirit of God (2).

            <br />
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Is God, then, not unjust by requiring in His law what man cannot do?</h4>
            <p>
                No, for God so created man that he was able to do it (1). But man, at the instigation of the devil (2),
                in deliberate disobedience (3) robbed himself and all his descendants of these gifts (4).
            </p>

            <br />
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Will God allow such disobedience and apostasy to go unpunished?</h4>
            <p>
                Certainly not. He is terribly displeased with our original sin as well as our actual sins. Therefore
                He will punish them by a just judgment both now and eternally (1), as He has declared (2): Cursed be
                every one who does not abide by all things written in the book of the law, and do them (3).

        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>But is God not also merciful?</h4>
            <p>
                God is indeed merciful (1), but He is also just (2). His justice requires that sin committed against
                the most high majesty of God also be punished with the most severe, that is, with everlasting,
                punishment of body and soul (3).

                Since, according to God's righteous judgment we deserve temporal and eternal punishment, how can we
                escape this punishment and be again received into favour?
            </h4>
            <p>
                God demands that His justice be satisfied (1). Therefore full payment must be made either by ourselves
                or by another (2).

            <br />
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Can we ourselves make this payment?</h4>
            <p>
                Certainly not. On the contrary, we daily increase our debt (1).

        <li>
            <h4>Can any mere creature pay for us?</h4>
            <p>
                No. In the first place, God will not punish another creature for the sin which man has committed (1).
                Furthermore, no mere creature can sustain the burden of God's eternal wrath against sin and deliver
                others from it (2).

        <li>
            <h4>What kind of mediator and deliverer must we seek?</h4>
            <p>
                One who is a true (1) and righteous (2) man, and yet more powerful than all creatures; that is, one
                who is at the same time true God (3).

        <li>
            <h4>Why must He be a true and righteous man?</h4>
            <p>
                He must be a true man because the justice of God requires that the same human nature which has sinned 
                should pay for sin (1). He must be a righteous man because one who himself is a sinner cannot pay for 
                others (2).

            <br />
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Why must He at the same time be true God?</h4>
            <p>
                He must be true God so that by the power of His divine nature (1) He might bear in His human nature 
                the burden of God's wrath (2), and might obtain for us and restore to us righteousness and life (3).

            <h4>But who is that Mediator who at the same time is true God and a true and righteous man?</h4>
            <p>
                Our Lord Jesus Christ (1), whom God made our wisdom, our righteousness and sanctification and 
                redemption (2).

            <h4>From where do you know this?</h4>
            <p>
                From the holy gospel, which God Himself first revealed in Paradise (1). Later, He had it proclaimed by 
                the patriarchs (2) and prophets (3), and foreshadowed by the sacrifices and other ceremonies of the 
                law (4). Finally, He had it fulfilled through His only Son (5).

            <p>
                No. Only those are saved who by a true faith are grafted into Christ and accept all His benefits (1).

        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>What is true faith?</h4>
            <p>
                True faith is a sure knowledge whereby I accept as true all that God has revealed to us in His 
                Word (1). At the same time it is a firm confidence (2) that not only to others, but also to me (3), God 
                has granted forgiveness of sins, everlasting righteousness, and salvation (4), out of mere grace, only 
                for the sake of Christ's merits (5). This faith the Holy Spirit works in my heart by the gospel (6).

            <p>
                All that is promised us in the Gospel (1), which the articles of our catholic and undoubted Christian 
                faith teach us in a summary.

            <h4>What are these articles?</h4>
            <p>
                I believe in God the Father almighty, Creator of heaven and earth. I believe in Jesus Christ, His only 
                begotten Son, our Lord; He was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the virgin Mary; He suffered under 
                Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried; He descended to the dead; On the third day He 
                arose from the dead; He ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of God the Father almighty; 
                From there He will come to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit; I believe a 
                holy catholic Christian church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of 
                the body, and the life everlasting.

                our redemption; the third about God the Holy Spirit and our sanctification.

                Because God has so revealed Himself in His Word (1) that these three distinct persons are the 
                one, true, eternal God (2).

            <p>
                That the eternal Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who out of nothing created heaven and earth and all 
                that is in them (1), and who still upholds and governs them by His eternal counsel and providence (2), 
                is, for the sake of Christ His Son, my God and my Father (3). In Him I trust so completely as to have 
                no doubt that He will provide me with all things necessary for body and soul (4), and will also turn 
                to my good whatever adversity He sends me in this life of sorrow (5). He is able to do so as almighty 
                God (6), and willing also as a faithful Father (7).

                God's providence is His almighty and ever present power (1), whereby, as with His hand, He still

                drought, fruitful and barren years, food and drink, health and sickness, riches and poverty (3),
                indeed, all things, come not by chance (4) but by His fatherly hand (5).
