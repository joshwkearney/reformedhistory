    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <h3>Of Baptism</h3>
    <br />
    
    <ol>
        <li>
            Baptism enters, receives, and seals a person in the catholic church and as a member of new covenant 
            <a href="#Baptism.Sources.1">(1)</a>, which
            is the kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ and the house and family of God 
            <a href="#Baptism.Sources.2">(2)</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Through baptism into this covenant
            a person is united to Christ’s death and resurrection, is cleansed of their sins by the blood of Lamb, and is
            regenerated by the Holy Spirit to live a new life <a href="#Baptism.Sources.3">(3)</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            All of these great gifts are wrought not by the water, but by the Holy Spirit which the water signifies 
            <a href="#Baptism.Sources.4">(4)</a>;
            nonetheless, the water and the Spirit are sacramentally united by the promises of God, so that as we
            administer the water we are undoubtably assured that the Spirit is truly present 
            <a href="#Baptism.Sources.5">(5)</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            The regenerating work of the Spirit is received and made effectual only by faith, so that without faith the
            gifts of the Spirit cannot be recieved 
            <a href="#Baptism.Sources.6">(6)</a>. If a baptized person renounces their faith, they resist the Holy
            Spirit, are cut off from the new covenant, and lose all spiritual benefits and hope of salvation 
            <a href="#Baptism.Sources.7">(7)</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            The Holy Spirit has promised to work through baptism but He is not constrained by it; God may regenerate a
            person by faith apart from the sacrament, or before its administration <a href="#Baptism.Sources.8">(8)</a>.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <br />

    <h4>We Affirm</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>That all who are baptized are joined to the new covenant and to Christ</li>
        <li>That all who are baptized participate in the Holy Spirit</li>
        <li>
            A distinction may be made between the effectual work of the Spirit for the elect, which is never lost,
            and the operations of the Spirit common to all in the new covenant, which can be lost
        </li>
        <li>That baptism is made effectual for salvation only by faith in Christ</li>
    </ul>
    <br />

    <h4>We Deny</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>That baptism is a "work of the law"</li>
        <li>That baptism is made effectual by performance of the rite, and not by the Spirit</li>
        <li>That all who are baptized are saved</li>
        <li>That the elect may fall away</li>
        <li>That all who participate in the Spirit are saved</li>
    </ul>

            Now to be baptized in the name of Christ is to be enrolled, entered, and received into the covenant 
            and family, and so into the inheritance of the sons of God; yes, and in this life to be called after 
            the name of God; that is to say, to be called a son of God.

            all members of the Church we might beautifully concur in the one religion and in mutual services.

            and of their children: and is the kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ, the house and family of God, out 
            of which there is no ordinary possibility of salvation.

            That the meaning may be more clear to us, let us treat of them separately. First, what is the meaning 
            of Baptism? It consists of two parts. The Lord represents to us in it, first, the forgiveness of our 
            sins (Ephesians 5:26-27) and, secondly, our regeneration or spiritual renewal (Romans 6:4).

            also raised with him through faith in the powerful working of God, who raised him from the dead. And 
            you, who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made alive together 
            with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses, by canceling the record of debt that stood against
            us with its legal demands. This he set aside, nailing it to the cross.

            and renewal of the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, so

            You do not mean that the water is a washing of the soul? By no means, for that pertains to the blood 
            of Christ alone, which was shed in order to wipe away all our stains and render us pure and unpolluted 
            before God (1 John 1:7, 1 Peter 1:19). This is fulfilled in us when our consciences are sprinkled by
            the Holy Spirit. But by the Sacrament that is sealed to us.

            And therefore we are baptized, that is, washed or sprinkled with visible water. For the water washes 
            dirt away, and cools and refreshes hot and tired bodies. And the grace of God performs these things 
            for souls, and does so invisibly or spiritually.

            really exhibited, and conferred, by the Holy Ghost, to such (whether of age or infants) as that 
            grace belongeth unto, according to the counsel of God's own will, in his appointed time.

            forgiveness of sins is offered to us and we receive it.

            assurance that we have our spiritual purity in Christ, and in feeling within us, and declaring to 
            our neighbours by our works, that His Spirit dwells in us to mortify our natural desires and bring 
            us to follow the Will of God.

            Holy Spirit was poured out even on the Gentiles. For they were hearing them speaking in tongues and
            extolling God. Then Peter declared, "Can anyone withhold water for baptizing these people, who have
            received the Holy Spirit just as we have?" And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus
