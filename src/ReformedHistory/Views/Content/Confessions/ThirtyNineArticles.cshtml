    <h2>Article 1</h2>
    <h3>Of Faith in the Holy Trinity</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        There is but one living and true God, everlasting, without body, parts, or passions; of infinite power, wisdom, 
        and goodness; the Maker, and Preserver of all things both visible and invisible. And in unity of this Godhead 
        there be three Persons, of one substance, power, and eternity; the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Article2">Article 2</h2>
    <h3>Of the Word or Son of God, Which Was Made Very Man</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        The Son, which is the Word of the Father, begotten from everlasting of the Father, the very and eternal God, 
        and of one substance with the Father, took Man's nature in the womb of the blessed Virgin, of her substance: so 
        that two whole and perfect Natures, that is to say, the Godhead and Manhood, were joined together in one 
        Person, never to be divided, whereof is one Christ, very God, and very Man; who truly suffered, was crucified, 
        dead, and buried, to reconcile his Father to us, and to be a sacrifice, not only for original guilt, but also 
        for actual sins of men.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Article3">Article 3</h2>
    <h3>Of the Going Down of Christ Into Hell</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        As Christ died for us, and was buried, so also is it to be believed, that he went down into Hell.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Article4">Article 4</h2>
    <h3>Of the Resurrection of Christ</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        Christ did truly rise again from death, and took again his body, with flesh, bones, and all things appertaining 
        to the perfection of Man's nature; wherewith he ascended into Heaven, and there sitteth, until he return to 
        judge all Men at the last day.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Article5">Article 5</h2>
    <h3>Of the Holy Ghost</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        The Holy Ghost, proceeding from the Father and the Son, is of one substance, majesty, and glory, with the 
        Father and the Son, very and eternal God.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Article6">Article 6</h2>
    <h3>Of the Sufficiency of the Holy Scriptures for Salvation</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        Holy Scripture containeth all things necessary to salvation: so that whatsoever is not read therein, nor may be
        proved thereby, is not to be required of any man, that it should be believed as an article of the Faith, or be 
        thought requisite or necessary to salvation. In the name of the Holy Scripture we do understand those canonical 
        Books of the Old and New Testament, of whose authority was never any doubt in the Church.

        The Names and Number of the Canonical Books:
    </p>
    <br />
    <i>
        Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, The First Book of Samuel, The Second 
        Book of Samuel, The First Book of Kings, The Second Book of Kings, The First Book of Chronicles, The Second 
        Book of Chronicles, The First Book of Esdras, The Second Book of Esdras, The Book of Esther, The Book of Job,
        The Psalms, The Proverbs, Ecclesiastes or Preacher, Cantica or Songs of Solomon, Four Prophets the greater,
        and Twelve Prophets the less.
    </i>
    <br /><br />
    <p>
        And the other Books (as Hierome saith) the Church doth read for example of life and instruction of manners; but yet
        doth it not apply them to establish any doctrine; such are these following:
    </p>
    <br />
    <i>
        The Third Book of Esdras, The Fourth Book of Esdras, The Book of Tobias, The Book of Judith, The rest of the 
        Book of Esther, The Book of Wisdom, Jesus the Son of Sirach, Baruch the Prophet, The Song of the Three 
        Children, The Story of Susanna Of Bel and the Dragon, The Prayer of Manasses, The First Book of Maccabees, The 
        Second Book of Maccabees.
    </i>
    <br /><br />
    <p>
        All the Books of the New Testament, as they are commonly received, we do receive, and account them Canonical.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Article7">Article 7</h2>
    <h3>Of the Old Testament</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        The Old Testament is not contrary to the New: for both in the Old and New Testament everlasting life is offered to
        Mankind by Christ, who is the only Mediator between God and Man, being both God and Man. Wherefore they are
        not to be heard, which feign that the old Fathers did look only for transitory promises. Although the Law given from
        God by Moses, as touching Ceremonies and Rites, do not bind Christian men, nor the Civil precepts thereof ought of
        necessity to be received in any commonwealth; yet notwithstanding, no Christian man whatsoever is free from the
        obedience of the Commandments which are called Moral.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Article8">Article 8</h2>
    <h3>Of the Creeds</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        The Three Creeds, Nicene Creed, Athanasius' Creed, and that which is commonly called the Apostles' Creed, ought
        thoroughly to be received and believed: for they may be proved by most certain warrants of Holy Scripture
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Article9">Article 9</h2>
    <h3>Of Original or Birth Sin</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        Original sin standeth not in the following of Adam, (as the Pelagians do vainly talk;) but it is the fault and corruption
        of the Nature of every man, that naturally is engendered of the offspring of Adam; whereby man is very far gone
        from original righteousness, and is of his own nature inclined to evil, so that the flesh lusteth always contrary to the
        Spirit; and therefore in every person born into this world, it deserveth God's wrath and damnation. And this infection
        of nature doth remain, yea in them that are regenerated; whereby the lust of the flesh, called in Greek, ,(which some
        do expound the wisdom, some sensuality, some the affection, some the desire, of the flesh), is not subject to the Law
        of God. And although there is no condemnation for them that believe and are baptized; yet the Apostle doth confess,
        that concupiscence and lust hath of itself the nature of sin.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Article10">Article 10</h2>
    <h3>Of Free Will</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        The condition of Man after the fall of Adam is such, that he cannot turn and prepare himself, by his own natural
        strength and good works, to faith; and calling upon God. Wherefore we have no power to do good works pleasant
        and acceptable to God, without the grace of God by Christ preventing us, that we may have a good will, and
        working with us, when we have that good will.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Article11">Article 11</h2>
    <h3>Of the Justification of Man</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        We are accounted righteous before God, only for the merit of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ by Faith, and not
        for our own works or deservings. Wherefore, that we are justified by Faith only, is a most wholesome Doctrine, and
        very full of comfort, as more largely is expressed in the Homily of Justification.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Article12">Article 12</h2>
    <h3>Of Good Works</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        Albeit that Good Works, which are the fruits of Faith, and follow after Justification, cannot put away our sins, and
        endure the severity of God's judgment; yet are they pleasing and acceptable to God in Christ, and do spring out
        necessarily of a true and lively Faith insomuch that by them a lively Faith may be as evidently known as a tree
        discerned by the fruit.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Article13">Article 13</h2>
    <h3>Of Works Before Justification</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        Works done before the grace of Christ, and the Inspiration of his Spirit, are not pleasant to God, forasmuch as they
        spring not of faith in Jesus Christ; neither do they make men meet to receive grace, or (as the School-authors say)
        deserve grace of congruity: yea rather, for that they are not done as God hath willed and commanded them to be
        done, we doubt not but they have the nature of sin.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Article14">Article 14</h2>
    <h3>Of Works of Supererogation</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        Voluntary Works besides, over and above, God's Commandments, which they call Works of Supererogation, cannot
        be taught without arrogancy and impiety: for by them men do declare, that they do not only render unto God as
        much as they are bound to do, but that they do more for his sake, than of bounden duty is required: whereas Christ
        saith plainly When ye have done all that are commanded to you, say, We are unprofitable servants.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Article15">Article 15</h2>
    <h3>Of Christ Alone Without Sin</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        Christ in the truth of our nature was made like unto us in all things, sin only except, from which he was clearly void,
        both in his flesh, and in his spirit. He came to be the Lamb without spot, who, by sacrifice of himself once made,
        should take away the sins of the world; and sin (as Saint John saith) was not in him. But all we the rest, although
        baptized and horn again in Christ, yet offend in many things; and if we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves,
        and the truth is not in us.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Article16">Article 16</h2>
    <h3>Of Sin After Baptism</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        Not every deadly sin willingly committed after Baptism is sin against the Holy Ghost, and unpardonable. Wherefore
        the grant of repentance is not to be denied to such as fall into sin after Baptism. After we have received the Holy
        Ghost, we may depart from grace given, and fall into sin, and by the grace of God we may arise again, and amend
        our lives. And therefore they are to be condemned, which say, they can no more sin as long as they live here, or
        deny the place of forgiveness to such as truly repent.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Article17">Article 17</h2>
    <h3>Of Predestination and Election</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        Predestination to Life is the everlasting purpose of God, whereby (before the foundations of the world were laid) he
        hath constantly decreed by his counsel secret to us, to deliver from curse and damnation those whom he hath chosen
        in Christ out of mankind, and to bring them by Christ to everlasting salvation, as vessels made to honour.
        Wherefore, they which be endued with so excellent a benefit of God, be called according to God's purpose by his
        Spirit working in due season: they through Grace obey the calling: they be justified freely: they be made sons of
        God by adoption: they be made like the image of his only-begotten Son Jesus Christ: they walk religiously in good
        works, and at length, by God's mercy, they attain to everlasting felicity.
        <br /><br />
        
        As the godly consideration of Predestination, and our Election in Christ, is full of sweet, pleasant, and unspeakable
        comfort to godly persons, and such as feel in themselves the working of the Spirit of Christ, mortifying the works of
        the flesh, and their earthly members, and drawing up their mind to high and heavenly things, as well because it doth
        greatly establish and confirm their faith of eternal Salvation to be enjoyed through Christ as because it doth fervently
        kindle their love towards God: So, for curious and carnal persons, lacking the Spirit of Christ, to have continually
        before their eyes the sentence of God's Predestination, is a most dangerous downfall, whereby the Devil doth thrust
        them either into desperation, or into wretchlessness of most unclean living, no less perilous than desperation.
        Furthermore, we must receive God's promises in such wise, as they be generally set forth to us in Holy Scripture:
        and, in our doings, that Will of God is to be followed, which we have expressly declared unto us in the Word of
        God.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Article18">Article 18</h2>
    <h3>Of Obtaining Eternal Salvation Only By the Name of Christ</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        They also are to be had accursed that presume to say, That every man shall be saved by the Law or Sect which he
        professeth, so that he be diligent to frame his life according to that Law, and the light of Nature. For Holy Scripture
        doth set out unto us only the Name of Jesus Christ, whereby men must be saved.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Article19">Article 19</h2>
    <h3>Of the Church</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        The visible Church of Christ is a congregation of faithful men, in which the pure Word of God is preached, and the
        Sacraments be duly ministered according to Christ's ordinance, in all those things that of necessity are requisite to
        the same.
        <br /><br />
        
        As the Church of Jerusalem, Alexandria, and Antioch, have erred, so also the Church of Rome hath erred, not only
        in their living and manner of Ceremonies, but also in matters of Faith.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Article20">Article 20</h2>
    <h3>Of the Authority of the Church</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        The Church hath power to decree Rites or Ceremonies, and authority in Controversies of Faith: and yet it is not
        lawful for the Church to ordain any thing that is contrary to God's Word written, neither may it so expound one
        place of Scripture, that it be repugnant to another. Wherefore, although the Church be a witness and a keeper of
        Holy Writ, yet, as it ought not to decree any thing against the same, so besides the same ought it not to enforce any
        thing to be believed for necessity of Salvation.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Article21">Article 21</h2>
    <h3>Of the Authority of General Councils</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        General Councils may not be gathered together without the commandment and will of Princes. And when they be
        gathered together, (forasmuch as they be an assembly of men, whereof all be not governed with the Spirit and Word
        of God), they may err, and sometimes have erred, even in things pertaining unto God. Wherefore things ordained by
        them as necessary to salvation have neither strength nor authority, unless it may be declared that they be taken out of
        holy Scripture.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Article22">Article 22</h2>
    <h3>Of Purgatory</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        The Romish Doctrine concerning Purgatory, Pardons, Worshipping and Adoration, as well of Images as of Relics,
        and also Invocation of Saints, is a fond thing, vainly invented, and grounded upon no warranty of Scripture, but
        rather repugnant to the Word of God.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Article23">Article 23</h2>
    <h3>Of Ministering in the Congregation</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        It is not lawful for any man to take upon him the office of public preaching, or ministering the Sacraments in the
        Congregation, before he be lawfully called, and sent to execute the same. And those we ought to judge lawfully
        called and sent, which be chosen and called to this work by men who have public authority given unto them in the
        Congregation, to call and send Ministers into the Lord's vineyard.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Article24">Article 24</h2>
    <h3>Of Speaking in the Congregation in Such a Tongue as the People Understandeth</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        It is a thing plainly repugnant to the Word of God, and the custom of the Primitive Church to have public Prayer in
        the Church, or to minister the Sacraments, in a tongue not understanded of the people.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Article25">Article 25</h2>
    <h3>Of the Sacraments</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of Christian men's profession, but rather they be certain
        sure witnesses, and effectual signs of grace, and God's good will towards us, by the which he doth work invisibly in
        us, and doth not only quicken, but also strengthen and confirm our Faith in him.
        There are two Sacraments ordained of Christ our Lord in the Gospel, that is to say, Baptism, and the Supper of the
        Lord.
        <br /><br />
        
        Those five commonly called Sacraments, that is to say, Confirmation, Penance, Orders, Matrimony, and Extreme
        Unction, are not to be counted for Sacraments of the Gospel, being such as have grown partly of the corrupt
        following of the Apostles, partly are states of life allowed in the Scriptures, but yet have not like nature of
        Sacraments with Baptism, and the Lord's Supper, for that they have not any visible sign or ceremony ordained of
        God.
        <br /><br />
        
        The Sacraments were not ordained of Christ to be gazed upon, or to be carried about, but that we should duly use
        them. And in such only as worthily receive the same, they have a wholesome effect or operation: but they that
        receive them unworthily, purchase to themselves damnation, as Saint Paul saith.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Article26">Article 26</h2>
    <h3>Of the Unworthiness of the Ministers, Which Hinders Not the Effects of the Sacraments</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        Although in the visible Church the evil be ever mingled with the good, and sometimes the evil have chief authority
        in the Ministration of the Word and Sacraments, yet forasmuch as they do not the same in their own name, but in
        Christ's, and do minister by his commission and authority, we may use their Ministry, both in hearing the Word of
        God, and in receiving the Sacraments. Neither is the effect of Christ's ordinance taken away by their wickedness, nor
        the grace of God's gifts diminished from such as by faith, and rightly, do receive the Sacraments ministered unto
        them; which be effectual, because of Christ's institution and promise, although they be ministered by evil men.
        Nevertheless, it appertaineth to the discipline of the Church, that inquiry be made of evil Ministers, and that they be
        accused by those that have knowledge of their offences; and finally, being found guilty, by just judgment be
        deposed.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Article27">Article 27</h2>
    <h3>Of Baptism</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        Baptism is not only a sign of profession, and mark of difference, whereby Christian men are discerned from others
        that be not christened, but it is also a sign of Regeneration or New-Birth, whereby, as by an instrument, they that
        receive Baptism rightly are grafted into the Church; the promises of the forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be
        the sons of God by the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed, Faith is confirmed, and Grace increased by virtue
        of prayer unto God.
        <br /><br />
        
        The Baptism of young Children is in any wise to be retained in the Church, as most agreeable with the institution of
        Christ.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Article28">Article 28</h2>
    <h3>Of the Lord's Supper</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        The Supper of the Lord is not only a sign of the love that Christians ought to have among themselves one to another,
        but rather it is a Sacrament of our Redemption by Christ's death: insomuch that to such as rightly, worthily, and with
        faith, receive the same, the Bread which we break is a partaking of the Body of Christ; and likewise the Cup of
        Blessing is a partaking of the Blood of Christ.
        <br /><br />
        
        Transubstantiation (or the change of the substance of Bread and Wine) in the Supper of the Lord, cannot be proved
        by Holy Writ; but is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture, overthroweth the nature of a Sacrament, and hath
        given occasion to many superstitions.
        <br /><br />
        
        The Body of Christ is given, taken, and eaten, in the Supper, only after an heavenly and spiritual manner. And the
        mean whereby the Body of Christ is received and eaten in the Supper, is Faith.
        The Sacrament of the Lord's Supper was not by Christ's ordinance reserved, carried about, lifted up, or worshipped.

    <h3>Of the Wicked, Which Eat Not the Body of Christ in the Use of the Lord's Supper</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        The Wicked, and such as be void of a lively faith, although they do carnally and visibly press with their teeth (as
        Saint Augustine saith) the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ; yet in no wise are they partakers of Christ:
        but rather, to their condemnation, do eat and drink the sign or Sacrament of so great a thing.

    <h3>Of Both Kinds</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        The Cup of the Lord is not to be denied to the Lay-people: for both the parts of the Lord's Sacrament, by Christ's
        ordinance and commandment, ought to be ministered to all Christian men alike.

    <h2 id="Article31">Article 31</h2>
    <h3>Of the One Oblation of Christ Finished Upon the Cross</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        The Offering of Christ once made is that perfect redemption, propitiation, and satisfaction, for all the sins of the
        whole world, both original and actual; and there is none other satisfaction for sin, but that alone. Wherefore the
        sacrifices of Masses, in the which it was commonly said, that the Priest did offer Christ for the quick and the dead,
        to have remission of pain or guilt, were blasphemous fables, and dangerous deceits.

    <h3>Of the Marriage of Priests</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        Bishops, Priests, and Deacons, are not commanded by God's Law, either to vow the estate of single life, or to abstain
        from marriage: therefore it is lawful for them, as for all other Christian men, to marry at their own discretion, as they
        shall judge the same to serve better to godliness.

    <h3>Of Excommunicate Persons, How They Are to be Avoided</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        That person which by open denunciation of the Church is rightly cut off from the unity of the Church, and
        excommunicated, ought to be taken of the whole multitude of the faithful, as an Heathen and Publican, until he be
        openly reconciled by penance, and received into the Church by a Judge that hath authority thereunto.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Article34">Article 34</h2>
    <h3>Of the Traditions of the Church</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        It is not necessary that Traditions and Ceremonies be in all places one, or utterly like; for at all times they have been
        divers, and may be changed according to the diversity of countries, times, and men's manners, so that nothing be
        ordained against God's Word. Whosoever, through his private judgment, willingly and purposely, doth openly break
        the Traditions and Ceremonies of the Church, which be not repugnant to the Word of God, and be ordained and
        approved by common authority, ought to be rebuked openly, (that others may fear to do the like), as he that
        offendeth against the common order of the Church, and hurteth the authority of the Magistrate, and woundeth the
        consciences of the weak brethren.
        <br /><br />
        
        Every particular or national Church hath authority to ordain, change, and abolish, Ceremonies or Rites of the Church
        ordained only by man's authority, so that all things be done to edifying.

    <h3>Of the Homilies</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        The Second Book of Homilies, the several titles whereof we have joined under this Article, doth contain a godly and
        wholesome Doctrine, and necessary for these times, as doth the former Book of Homilies, which were set forth in
        the time of Edward the Sixth; and therefore we judge them to be read in Churches by the Ministers, diligently and
        distinctly, that they may be understanded of the people.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Of the Names of the Homilies</h4>
    <br /><br />
    <ol>
        <li>Of the Right Use of the Church</li>
        <li>Against Peril of Idolatry</li>
        <li>Of Repairing and Keeping Clean of Churches</li>
        <li>Of Good Works, First of Fasting</li>
        <li>Against Gluttony and Drunkenness</li>
        <li>Against Excess of Apparel</li>
        <li>Of Prayer</li>
        <li>Of the Place and Time of Prayer</li>
        <li>That Common Prayers and Sacraments Ought to be Ministers in a Known Tongue</li>
        <li>Of the Reverent Estimation of God's Word</li>
        <li>Of Alms-doing</li>
        <li>Of the Nativity of Christ</li>
        <li>Of the Passion of Christ</li>
        <li>Of the Resurrection of Christ</li>
        <li>Of the Worthy Receiving of the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ</li>
        <li>Of the Gifts of the Holy Ghost</li>
        <li>For the Rogation-days</li>
        <li>Of the State of Matrimony</li>
        <li>Of Repentence</li>

    <h2 id="Article36">Article 36</h2>
    <h3>Of Consecration of Bishops and Ministers</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        The Book of Consecration of Archbishops and Bishops, and Ordering of Priests and Deacons, lately set forth in the
        time of Edward the Sixth, and confirmed at the same time by authority of Parliament, doth contain all things
        necessary to such Consecration and Ordering: neither hath it any thing, that of itself is superstitious and ungodly.
        And therefore whosoever are consecrated or ordered according to the Rites of that Book, since the second year of
        the forenamed King Edward unto this time, or hereafter shall be consecrated or ordered according to the same Rites;
        we decree all such to be rightly, orderly, and lawfully consecrated and ordered.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Article37">Article 37</h2>
    <h3></h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        The King's Majesty hath the chief power in this Realm of England, and other his Dominions, unto whom the chief
        Government of all Estates of this Realm, whether they be Ecclesiastical or Civil, in all causes doth appertain, and is
        not, nor ought to be, subject to any foreign Jurisdiction.
        <br /><br />
        
        Where we attribute to the King's Majesty the chief government, by which Titles we understand the minds of some
        slanderous folks to be offended; we give not our Princes the ministering either of God's Word, or of the Sacraments,
        the which thing the Injunctions also lately set forth by Elizabeth our Queen do most plainly testify; but that only
        prerogative, which we see to have been given always to all godly Princes in holy Scriptures by God himself; that is,
        that they should rule all estates and degrees committed to their charge by God, whether they be Ecclesiastical or
        Temporal, and restrain with the civil sword the stubborn and evil-doers.
        <br /><br />
        
        The Bishop of Rome hath no jurisdiction in this Realm of England.
        <br /><br />
        
        The Laws of the Realm may punish Christian men with death, for heinous and grievous offences.
        It is lawful for Christian men, at the commandment of the Magistrate, to wear weapons, and serve in the wars.

    <h2 id="Article38">Article 38</h2>
    <h3>Of Christian Men's Goods, Which Are Not Common</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        The Riches and Goods of Christians are not common, as touching the right, title, and possession of the same; as
        certain Anabaptists do falsely boast. Notwithstanding, every man ought, of such things as he possesseth, liberally to
        give alms to the poor, according to his ability.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Article39">Article 39</h2>
    <h3>Of a Christian man's Oath</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        As we confess that vain and rash swearing is forbidden Christian men by our Lord Jesus Christ, and James his
        Apostle, so we judge, that Christian Religion doth not prohibit, but that a man may swear when the Magistrate
        requireth, in a cause of faith and charity, so it be done according to the Prophet's teaching in justice, judgement, and
        truth.
