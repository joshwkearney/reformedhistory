    <h2>Preface</h2>
    <p>
        Since Pope Paul III convoked a Council last year, to assemble at Mantua about Whitsuntide, and afterwards 
        transferred it from Mantua, so that it is not yet known where he will or can fix it, and we on our part either 
        had to expect that we would be summoned also to the Council or to fear that we would be condemned unsummoned, 
        I was directed to compile and collect the articles of our doctrine, in order that it might be plain, in case of 
        deliberation as to what and how far we would be both willing and able to yield to the Papists, and in what 
        points we intended to persevere and abide to the end.
        <br /><br />

        I have accordingly compiled these articles and presented them to our side. They have also been accepted and
        unanimously confessed by our side, and it has been resolved that, in case the Pope with his adherents should 
        ever be so bold as seriously and in good faith, without lying and cheating, to hold a truly free 
        Christian Council (as, indeed, he would be in duty bound to do), they be publicly delivered in order to set 
        forth the Confession of our Faith.
        <br /><br />

        But though the Romish court is so dreadfully afraid of a free Christian Council, and shuns the light so 
        shamefully, that it has entirely removed, even from those who are on its side, the hope that it will ever 
        permit a free Council, much less that it will itself hold one, whereat, as is just, they are 
        greatly offended and have no little trouble on that account, 
        since they notice thereby that the Pope would rather see all Christendom perish and all souls damned than 
        suffer either himself or his adherents to be reformed even a little, and his their tyranny to be limited, 
        nevertheless I have determined meanwhile to publish these articles in plain print, so that, should I die 
        before there would be a Council (as I fully expect and hope, because the knaves who flee the light and shun the 
        day take such wretched pains to delay and hinder the Council), those who live and remain after me may have my 
        testimony and confession to produce, in addition to the Confession which I have issued previously, whereby up 
        to this time I have abided, and, by God's grace, will abide.
        <br /><br />

        For what shall I say? How shall I complain? I am still living, writing, preaching, and lecturing daily; and yet 
        there are found such spiteful men, not only among the adversaries, but also false brethren that profess to be 
        on our side, as dare to cite my writings and doctrine directly against myself, and let me look on and listen, 
        although they know well that I teach otherwise, and as wish to adorn their venom with my labor, and under my 
        name to deceive and mislead the poor people. Good God! Alas! What first will happen when I am dead?
        <br /><br />

        Indeed, I ought to reply to everything while I am still living. But, again, how can I alone stop all the 
        mouths of the devil? Especially of those (as they all are poisoned) who will not hear or notice what we write, 
        but solely exercise themselves with all diligence how they may most shamefully pervert and corrupt our word in 
        every letter. These I let the devil answer, or at last God's wrath, as they deserve.
        <br /><br />

        I often think of the good person, who doubts whether anything good should be written and published. If it is 
        not done, many souls are neglected who could be delivered; but if it is done, the devil is there with 
        malignant, villainous tongues without number which envenom and pervert everything, so that nevertheless the 
        fruit of the writings is prevented.
        <br /><br />

        Yet what they gain thereby is manifest. For while they have lied so shamefully against us and by means of lies 
        wished to retain the people, God has constantly advanced His work, and been making their following ever smaller
        and ours greater, and by their lies has caused and still causes them to be brought to shame.
        <br /><br />

        I must tell a story. There was a doctor sent here to Wittenberg from France, who said publicly before us that 
        his king was sure and more than sure, that among us there is no church, no magistrate, no married life, but all 
        live promiscuously as cattle, and each one does as he pleases.
        <br /><br />

        Imagine now, how will those who by their writings have instilled such gross lies into the king and other 
        countries as the pure truth, look at us on that day before the judgment-seat of Christ? Christ, the Lord and 
        Judge of us all, knows well that they lie and have always lied, His sentence they in turn, must hear; that I 
        know certainly. God convert to repentance those who can be converted! Regarding the rest it will be said, Woe,
        and, alas! eternally.
        <br /><br />

        But to return to the subject. I verily desire to see a truly Christian Council, in order 
        that many matters and persons might be helped. Not that we need it, for our churches are now, through God's 
        grace, so enlightened and equipped with the pure Word and right use of the Sacraments, with knowledge of the 
        various callings and of right works, that we on our part ask for no Council, and on such points have nothing 
        better to hope or expect from a Council. But we see in the bishoprics everywhere so many parishes vacant and 
        desolate that one's heart would break, and yet neither the bishops nor canons care how the poor people live or 
        die, for whom nevertheless Christ has died, and who are not permitted to hear Him speak with them as the true 
        Shepherd with His sheep.
        <br /><br />

        This causes me to shudder and fear that at some time He may send a council of angels upon Germany utterly 
        destroying us, like Sodom and Gomorrah, because we so wantonly mock Him with the Council.
        <br /><br />

        Besides such necessary ecclesiastical affairs, there would be also in the political estate innumerable matters 
        of great importance to improve. There is the disagreement between the princes and the states; usury and avarice 
        have burst in like a flood, and have become lawful; wantonness, lewdness, 
        extravagance in dress, gluttony, gambling, idle display, with all kinds of bad habits and wickedness, 
        insubordination of subjects, of domestics and laborers, of every trade, also the exactions 
        of the peasants (and who can enumerate all?) have so increased that they cannot be rectified by 
        ten Councils and twenty Diets.
        <br /><br />

        If such chief matters of the spiritual and worldly estates as are contrary to God would be considered in the 
        Council, they would have all hands so full that the child's play and absurdity of long gowns, 
        large tonsures, broad cinctures, bishops' or cardinals' hats or maces, and like jugglery 
        would in the mean time be forgotten. If we first had performed God's command and order in the spiritual and 
        secular estate, we would find time enough to reform food, clothing, tonsures, and surplices. But if we want to 
        swallow such camels, and, instead, strain at gnats, let the beams stand and judge the motes, we also might 
        indeed be satisfied with the Council.
        <br /><br />

        Therefore I have presented few articles; for we have without this so many commands of God to observe in the 
        Church, the state, and the family that we can never fulfil them. What, then, is the use, or what does it profit 
        that many decrees and statutes thereon are made in the Council, especially when these chief matters commanded 
        of God are neither regarded nor observed? Just as though He were bound to honor our jugglery as a reward of our 
        treading His solemn commandments under foot. But our sins weigh upon us and cause God not to be gracious to us; 
        for we do not repent, and, besides, wish to defend every abomination.
        <br /><br />

        O Lord Jesus Christ, do Thou Thyself convoke a Council, and deliver Thy servants by Thy glorious advent! The 
        Pope and his adherents are done for; they will have none of Thee. Do Thou, then, help us, who are poor and 
        needy, who sigh to Thee, and beseech Thee earnestly, according to the grace which Thou hast given us, through 
        Thy Holy Ghost, who liveth and reigneth with Thee and the Father, blessed forever. Amen.

    <h3>Treats of the Sublime Articles Concerning the Divine Majesty</h3>
    <br />
    <ol>
        <li>
            That Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, three distinct persons in one divine essence and nature, are one God, who 
            has created heaven and earth.
        </li>
        <li>
            That the Father is begotten of no one; the Son of the Father; the Holy Ghost proceeds from Father and Son.
        </li>
        <li>
            That not the Father nor the Holy Ghost but the Son became man.
        </li>
        <li>
            That the Son became man in this manner, that He was conceived, without the cooperation of man, by the Holy
            Ghost, and was born of the pure, holy and always Virgin Mary. Afterwards He suffered, died, was buried, 
            descended to hell, rose from the dead, ascended to heaven, sits at the right hand of God, will come to 
            judge the quick and the dead, etc., as the Creed of the Apostles, as well as that of St. Athanasius, and 
            the Catechism in common use for children, teach.
        </li>
        <li>
            Concerning these articles there is no contention or dispute, since we on both sides confess them. Therefore 
            it is not necessary now to treat further of them.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    
    <h2 id="Article2.1">Part II, Article I</h2>
    <h3>The First and Chief Article</h3>
    <br />
    <ol>
        <li>
            That Jesus Christ, our God and Lord, died for our sins, and was raised again for our justification 
            (Romans 4:25).
        </li>
        <li>
            And He alone is the Lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the world (John 1:29); and God has laid upon 
            Him the iniquities of us all (Isaiah 53:6).
        </li>
        <li>
            Likewise: All have sinned and are justified without merit 
            by His grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, in His blood (Romans 3:23).
        </li>
        <li>
            Now, since it is necessary to believe this, and it cannot be otherwise acquired or apprehended by any 
            work, law, or merit, it is clear and certain that this faith alone justifies us as St. Paul says, in 
            Romans 3:28: For we conclude that a man is justified by faith, without the deeds of the Law. Likewise, 
            in Romans 3:26: That He might be just, and the Justifier of him which believeth in Christ.
        </li>
        <li>
            Of this article nothing can be yielded or surrendered, nor can anything be granted or permitted contrary to 
            the same, even though heaven and earth, and whatever will not abide, should sink to ruin. For there is none 
            other name under heaven, given among men whereby we must be saved, says Peter (Acts 4:12). And with His 
            stripes we are healed (Isaiah 53:5). And upon this article all things depend which we teach and practice in 
            opposition to the Pope, the devil, and the whole world. Therefore, we must be sure concerning this 
            doctrine, and not doubt; for otherwise all is lost, and the Pope and devil and all things gain the victory 
            and suit over us.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    
    <h2 id="Article2.2">Part II, Article II</h2>
    <h3>Of the Mass</h3>
    <br />
    <ol>
        <li>
            That the Mass in the Papacy must be the greatest and most horrible abomination, as it directly and 
            powerfully conflicts with this chief article, and yet above and before all other popish idolatries it has 
            been the chief and most specious. For it has been held that this sacrifice or work of the Mass, even though 
            it be rendered by a wicked scoundrel, frees men from sins, both in this life and also in 
            purgatory, while only the Lamb of God shall and must do this, as has been said above. Of this article 
            nothing is to be surrendered or conceded, because the first article does not allow it.
        </li>
        <li>
            If, perchance, there were reasonable Papists we might speak moderately and in a friendly way, thus: first, 
            why they so rigidly uphold the Mass. For it is but a pure invention of men, and has not been commanded by 
            God; and every invention of man we may safely discard, as Christ declares (Matthew 15:9): In vain do they 
            worship Me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.
        </li>
        <li>
            Secondly. It is an unnecessary thing, which can be omitted without sin and danger.
        </li>
        <li>
            Thirdly. The Sacrament can be received in a better and more blessed way, (yea, 
            the only blessed way), according to the institution of Christ. Why, then, do they drive the world to woe 
            and misery on account of a fictitious, unnecessary matter, which can be well obtained in another 
            and more blessed way?
        </li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    
    <h2 id="Article2.3">Part II, Article III</h2>
    <h3>Of Chapters and Cloisters</h3>
    <br />
    <ol>
        <li>
            That chapters and cloisters, which were formerly founded 
            with the good intention to educate learned men and chaste women, ought 
            again to be turned to such use, in order that pastors, preachers, and other ministers of the churches may 
            be had; and likewise other necessary persons for the secular 
            government in cities and countries, and well-educated maidens for mothers and 
            housekeepers, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
            If they will not serve this purpose, it is better that they be abandoned or razed, rather than 
            with their blasphemous services invented by men, regarded as something better than the ordinary 
            Christian life and the offices and callings ordained by God. For all this also is contrary to the first 
            chief article concerning the redemption made through Jesus Christ. Add to this that (like all other human 
            inventions) these have neither been commanded; they are needless and useless, and, besides, afford occasion 
            for dangerous and vain labor, such services as the prophets call Aven, i.e., pain and labor.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    
    <h2 id="Article2.4">Part II, Article IV</h2>
    <h3>Of the Papacy</h3>
    <br />
    <ol>
        <li>
            That the Pope is not, according to divine law or according to the Word of God the head of all Christendom 
            (for this name belongs to One only, whose name is Jesus Christ), but is only the bishop and pastor of 
            the Church at Rome, and of those who voluntarily or through a human creature (that is, a political 
            magistrate) have attached themselves to him, to be Christians, not under him as a lord, but with him as 
            brethren and comrades, as the ancient councils and the age of St. Cyprian show.
        </li>
        <li>
            But to-day none of the bishops dare to address the Pope as brother as was done at that time; 
            but they must call him most gracious lord, even though they be kings or emperors. Such 
            arrogance we will not, cannot, must not take upon our conscience. Let 
            him, however, who will do it, do so without us at his own risk.
        </li>
        <li>
            Hence it follows that all things which the Pope, from a power so false, mischievous, blasphemous, and 
            arrogant, has done and undertaken.have been and still are purely diabolical affairs and transactions (with 
            the exception of such things as pertain to the secular government, where God often permits much good to be 
            effected for a people, even through a tyrant and scoundrel) for the ruin of the entire holy 
            Christian Church (so far as it is in his power) and for the destruction of the first and 
            chief article concerning the redemption made through Jesus Christ.
        </li>
        <li>
            For all his bulls and books are extant, in which he roars like a lion (as the angel in Revelation 12 depicts him, 
            crying out that no Christian can be saved unless he obeys him and is subject to him in all things that he 
            wishes, that he says, and that he does. All of which amounts to nothing less than saying: Although you 
            believe in Christ, and have in Him everything that is necessary to salvation, yet it is nothing and 
            all in vain unless you regard me as your god, and be subject and obedient to me. And yet 
            it is manifest that the holy Church has been without the Pope for at least more than five hundred years, 
            and that even to the present day the churches of the Greeks and of many other languages neither have been 
            nor are yet under the Pope.
        </li>
        <li>
            Besides, as often remarked, it is a human figment which is not commanded, and is unnecessary and useless; 
            for the holy Christian Church can exist very well without such a head, and it would certainly
            have remained better if such a head had not been raised up by the devil.
        </li>
        <li>
            And the Papacy is also of no use in the Church, because it exercises no Christian office; and therefore 
            it is necessary for the Church to continue and to exist without the Pope.
        </li>
        <li>
            And supposing that the Pope would yield this point, so as not to be supreme by divine right or from God's 
            command, but that we must have [there must be elected] a [certain] head, to whom all the rest adhere [as 
            their support] in order that the [concord and] unity of Christians may be preserved against sects and 
            heretics, and that such a head were chosen by men, and that it were placed within the choice and power of 
            men to change or remove this head, just as the Council of Constance adopted nearly this course with 
            reference to the Popes, deposing three and electing a fourth; supposing, I say, that the Pope and See at 
            Rome would yield and accept this (which, nevertheless, is impossible; for thus he would have to suffer his 
            entire realm and estate to be overthrown and destroyed, with all his rights and books, a thing which, to 
            speak in few words, he cannot do), nevertheless, even in this way Christianity would not be helped, but 
            many more sects would arise than before.
        </li>
        <li>
            For since men would have to be subject to this head, not from God's command, but from their personal good 
            pleasure, it would easily and in a short time be despised, and at last retain no member; neither would it 
            have to be forever confined to Rome or any other place, but it might be wherever and in whatever church God
            would grant a man fit for the office. Oh, the complicated and confused state 
            of affairs that would result!
        </li>
        <li>
            Therefore the Church can never be better governed and preserved than if we all live under one head, Christ, 
            and all the bishops equal in office (although they be unequal in gifts), be diligently joined in unity of 
            doctrine, faith, Sacraments, prayer, and works of love, etc., as 
            <a href="/Content/Letters/JeromeToEvangelus2">St. Jerome writes</a> that the priests at 
            Alexandria together and in common governed the churches, as did also the apostles, and afterwards all 
            bishops throughout all Christendom, until the Pope raised his head above all.
        </li>
        <li>
            This teaching shows forcefully that the Pope is the very Antichrist, who has exalted himself above, and
            opposed himself against Christ because he will not permit Christians to be saved without his power, which, 
            nevertheless, is nothing, and is neither ordained nor commanded by God.
        </li>
        <li>
            This is, properly speaking to exalt himself above all that is called God as Paul says 
            (2 Thessalonians 2:4). Even the Turks or the Tartars, great enemies of Christians as they are, do not do 
            this, but they allow whoever wishes to believe in Christ, and take bodily tribute and obedience from 
            Christians.
        </li>
        <li>
            The Pope, however, prohibits this faith, saying that to be saved a person must obey him. This we are 
            unwilling to do, even though on this account we must die in God's name.
        </li>
        <li>
            This all proceeds from the fact that the Pope has wished to be called the supreme head of the Christian 
            Church by divine right. Accordingly he had to make himself equal and superior to Christ, and had to cause 
            himself to be proclaimed the head and then the lord of the Church, and finally of the whole world, and 
            simply God on earth, until he has dared to issue commands even to the angels in heaven.
        </li>
        <li>
            And when we distinguish the Pope's teaching from, or measure and hold it against, Holy Scripture, it is 
            found that the Pope's teaching, where it is best, has been taken from the imperial and 
            heathen law, and treats of political matters and decisions or rights, as the Decretals show; furthermore, 
            it teaches of ceremonies concerning churches, garments, food, persons and puerile, theatrical and 
            comical things without measure, but in all these things nothing at all of Christ, faith, and the 
            commandments of God. Lastly, it is nothing else than the devil himself, because above and against God he 
            urges his papal falsehoods concerning masses, purgatory, the monastic life, one's own 
            works and fictitious divine worship (for this is the very Papacy), and condemns, murders and tortures 
            all Christians who do not exalt 
            and honor these abominations above all things. Therefore, just as little as we can worship 
            the devil himself as Lord and God, we can endure his apostle, the Pope, or Antichrist, in his rule as head
            or lord. For to lie and to kill, and to destroy body and soul eternally, that is wherein his papal 
            government really consists, as I have very clearly shown in many books.
        </li>
        <li>
            In these four articles they will have enough to condemn in the Council. For they cannot and will not 
            concede us even the least point in one of these articles. Of this we should be certain, and animate
            ourselves with the hope that Christ, our Lord, has attacked His adversary,
            and he will press the attack home both by His Spirit and coming. Amen.
        </li>
        <li>
            For in the Council we will stand not before the Emperor or the political magistrate, as at Augsburg (where 
            the Emperor published a most gracious edict, and caused matters to be heard kindly), 
            but we will appear before the Pope and devil himself, who intends to listen to nothing, but merely when 
            the case has been publicly announced to condemn, to murder and to force us to idolatry. Therefore we ought
            not here to kiss his feet, or to say: "Thou art my gracious lord", but as the angel in Zechariah 3:2 said 
            to Satan: The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan.

    <h3>Of Sin</h3>
    <br />
    <ol>
        <li>
            Here we must confess, as Paul says in Romans 5:12, that sin originated from one man 
            Adam, by whose disobedience all men were made sinners, and subjected to death and the devil. This is 
            called original or capital sin.
        </li>
        <li>
            The fruits of this sin are afterwards the evil deeds which are forbidden in the Ten Commandments, such as 
            unbelief, false faith, idolatry, to be without the fear of God, presumption, 
            despair, blindness, and, in short not to know or regard God; furthermore to 
            lie, to swear by God's name, not to pray, not to call upon God, not to regard 
            God's Word, to be disobedient to parents, to murder, to be unchaste, to steal, to deceive, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
            This hereditary sin is so deep and horrible a corruption of nature that no reason can understand it, but it 
            must be learned and believed from the revelation of Scriptures (Psalm 51:5; Romans 6:12; Exodus 33:3; 
            Genesis 3:7). Hence, it is nothing but error and blindness in regard to this article what the scholastic 
            doctors have taught, namely:
        </li>
        <li>
            That since the fall of Adam the natural powers of man have remained entire and incorrupt, and that man by 
            nature has a right reason and a good will; which things the philosophers teach.
        </li>
        <li>
            Again, that man has a free will to do good and omit evil, and, conversely, to omit good and do evil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Again, that man by his natural powers can observe and keep all the commands of God.
        </li>
        <li>
            Again, that, by his natural powers, man can love God above all things and his neighbor as himself.
        </li>
        <li>
            Again, if a man does as much as is in him, God certainly grants him His grace.
        </li>
        <li>
            Again, if he wishes to go to the Sacrament, there is no need of a good intention to do good, but it is
            sufficient if he has not a wicked purpose to commit sin; so entirely good is his nature and so efficacious 
            the Sacrament.
        </li>
        <li>
            Again, that it is not founded upon Scripture that for a good work the Holy Ghost with His grace is 
            necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
            Such and many similar things have arisen from want of understanding and ignorance as regards both this sin 
            and Christ, our Savior, and they are truly heathen dogmas, which we cannot endure. For if this teaching 
            were right, then Christ has died in vain, since there is in man no defect nor sin for which he should have 
            died; or He would have died only for the body, not for the soul, inasmuch as the soul is entirely sound, 
            and the body only is subject to death.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    
    <h2 id="Article3.2">Part III, Article II</h2>
    <h3>Of the Law</h3>
    <br />
    <ol>
        <li>
            Here we hold that the Law was given by God, first, to restrain sin by threats and the dread of punishment, 
            and by the promise and offer of grace and benefit. But all this miscarried on account of the wickedness 
            which sin has wrought in man.
        </li>
        <li>
            For thereby a part were rendered worse, those, namely, who are hostile to the Law, because it forbids what 
            they like to do, and enjoins what they do not like to do. Therefore, wherever they can escape, if they were 
            not restrained by punishment, they would do more against the Law than before. These, then, are the rude and 
            wicked men, who do evil wherever they have the opportunity.
        </li>
        <li>
            The rest become blind and arrogant, and insolently conceive the opinion that they observe and can observe 
            the Law by their own powers, as has been said above concerning the scholastic theologians; thence come the 
            hypocrites and false saints.
        </li>
        <li>
            But the chief office or force of the Law is that it reveals original sin with all its fruits, and show man 
            how very low his nature has fallen, and has become utterly corrupted; as the Law must tell man that he has 
            no God nor regards God, and worships other gods, a matter which before and without the Law he would not 
            have believed. In this way he becomes terrified, is humbled, desponds, despairs, and anxiously desires aid,
            but sees no escape; he begins to be an enemy of God, and to murmur, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
            This is what Paul says, "The Law worketh wrath" (Romans 4:15), and "Sin is increased by the Law" 
            (Romans 5:20). 
        </li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    
    <h2 id="Article3.3">Part III, Article III</h2>
    <h3>Of Repentence</h3>
    <br />
    <ol>
        <li>
            This office of the Law the New Testament retains and urges, as St. Paul does, saying, "The 
            wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men" (Romans 1:18). 
            And again, "All the world is guilty before God" (Romans 3:19). No man is righteous before Him. And Christ 
            says, "The Holy Ghost will reprove the world of sin" (John 16:8).
        </li>
        <li>
            This, then, is the thunderbolt of God by which He strikes in a heap both manifest 
            sinners and false saints, and suffers no one to be in the right, 
            but drives them all together to terror and despair. This is the hammer, as Jeremiah says, "Is not My 
            Word like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces?" (Jeremiah 23:29). This is not <i>activa contritio</i> 
            or manufactured repentance, but <i>passiva contritio</i>, true sorrow of heart, suffering, and sensation 
            of death.
        </li>
        <li>
            This, then, is what it means to begin true repentance; and here man must hear such a sentence as this: You 
            are all of no account, whether you be manifest sinners or saints; you all must become 
            different and do otherwise than you now are and are doing, whether 
            you are as great, wise, powerful, and holy as you may. Here no one is righteous, holy, godly, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
            But to this office the New Testament immediately adds the consolatory promise of grace through the Gospel, 
            which must be believed, as Christ declares, "Repent and believe the Gospel" (Mark 1:15), i.e., become 
            different and do otherwise, and believe My promise. And John, preceding Him, is called a preacher of 
            repentance, however, for the remission of sins, i.e., John was to accuse all, and convict them of being 
            sinners, that they might know what they were before God, and might acknowledge that they were lost men, 
            and might thus be prepared for the Lord, to receive grace, and to expect and accept from Him the remission 
            of sins. Thus also Christ Himself says, "Repentance and remission of sins must be preached in My name among 
            all nations" (Luke 24:47).
        </li>
        <li>
            But whenever the Law alone, without the Gospel being added exercises this its office there is nothing else 
            but death and hell, and man must despair, like Saul and Judas; as St. Paul says, "Through 
            sin the Law killeth" (Romans 7:10).
        </li>
        <li>
            On the other hand, the Gospel brings consolation and remission not only in one way, but through the word 
            and Sacraments, and the like, as we shall hear afterward in order that there is with the Lord 
            plenteous redemption, as Psalm 130:7 says against the dreadful captivity of sin.
        </li>
        <li>
            However, we must now contrast the false repentance of the sophists with true repentance, in order that both 
            may be the better understood. Of the False Repentance of the Papists:
        </li>
        <li>
            It was impossible that they should teach correctly concerning repentance, since they did not rightly 
            know the real sins. For, as has been shown above, they do not believe aright concerning 
            original sin, but say that the natural powers of man have remained unimpaired and incorrupt; 
            that reason can teach aright, and the will can in accordance therewith do aright; 
            that God certainly bestows His grace when a man does as much as is in him, according 
            to his free will.
        </li>
        <li>
            It had to follow from this dogma that they did penance only for actual sins, such as 
            wicked thoughts to which a person yields (for wicked emotion, lust and improper dispositions, according to 
            them, are not sins), and for wicked words and wicked deeds, which free will could readily have omitted.
        </li>
        <li>
            And of such repentance they fix three parts, contrition, confession, and satisfaction, with this 
            consolation and promise added: If man truly repent, confess, render 
            satisfaction, he thereby would have merited forgiveness, and paid for his sins before God. Thus in 
            repentance they instructed men to repose confidence in their own works.
        </li>
        <li>
            Hence the expression originated, which was employed in the pulpit when public absolution was announced to 
            the people: "Prolong O God, my life, until I shall make satisfaction for my sins and amend my life."
        </li>
        <li>
            There was here no mention of Christ nor faith; but men hoped by their own works to 
            overcome and blot out sins before God. And with this intention we became priests and monks, that we might
            array ourselves against sin.
        </li>
        <li>
            As to contrition, this is the way it was done: Since no one could remember all his sins (especially as 
            committed through an entire year), they inserted this provision, namely, that if an unknown sin should be
            remembered later, this also must be repented 
            of and confessed, etc. Meanwhile they were commended to the grace of God.
        </li>
        <li>
            Moreover, since no one could know how great the contrition ought to be in order to be sufficient before 
            God, they gave this consolation: He who could not have contrition, at least ought to have attrition, 
            which I may call half a contrition or the beginning of contrition; for they have themselves understood 
            neither of these terms nor do they understand them now, as little as I. Such attrition was reckoned as
            contrition when a person went to confession.
        </li>
        <li>
            And when it happened that any one said that he could not have contrition nor lament his sins (as might 
            have occurred in illicit love or the desire for revenge, etc.), they asked whether he did not wish or 
            desire to have contrition. When one would reply Yes (for who, save the devil himself, would here 
            say No?), they accepted this as contrition, and forgave him his sins on account of this good work of his. 
            Here they cited the example of St. Bernard, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
            Here we see how blind reason, in matters pertaining to God, gropes about, and, according to its own 
            imagination, seeks for consolation in its own works, and cannot think of Christ and
            faith. But if it be clearly viewed in the light, this contrition is a manufactured and fictitious 
            thought, derived from man's own powers, without faith and without the knowledge of 
            Christ. And in it the poor sinner, when he reflected upon his own lust and desire for revenge, would 
            sometimes have laughed rather than wept, except such as either had been truly struck by the Law, or had 
            been vainly vexed by the devil with a sorrowful spirit. Otherwise such 
            contrition was certainly mere hypocrisy, and did not mortify the lust for sins; for they
            had to grieve, while they would rather have continued to sin, if it had been free to them.
        </li>
        <li>
            As regards confession, the procedure was this: Every one had to enumerate all his sins 
            (which is an impossible thing). This was a great torment. From such as he had forgotten 
            he would be absolved on the condition that, if they would occur to him, he must 
            still confess them. In this way he could never know whether he had made a sufficiently pure confession, 
            or when confessing would ever have an end. Yet he was pointed to his own works, 
            and comforted thus: The more sincerely and frankly one confesses, and the more he humiliates 
            himself and debases himself before the priest, the sooner and better he renders satisfaction for his 
            sins; for such humility certainly would earn grace before God.
        </li>
        <li>
            Here, too, there was no faith nor Christ, and the virtue of the absolution was not declared to him, but 
            upon his enumeration of sins and his self-abasement depended his consolation. What torture, rascality, and
            idolatry such confession has produced is more than can be related.
        </li>
        <li>
            As to satisfaction, this is by far the most perplexing part of all. For no man could know how 
            much to render for a single sin, not to say how much for all. Here they have resorted to the device of 
            imposing a small satisfaction, which could indeed be rendered, as five Paternosters, a day's fast, etc.; 
            for the rest that was lacking in their repentance they were directed to purgatory.
        </li>
        <li>
            Here, too, there was nothing but anguish and misery. For some thought that they would never 
            get out of purgatory, because, according to the old canons, seven years' repentance is required for a 
            single mortal sin.
        </li>
        <li>
            Nevertheless, confidence was placed upon our work of satisfaction, and if the satisfaction could have been 
            perfect, confidence would have been placed in it entirely, and neither faith nor Christ would have been of
            use. But this confidence was impossible. For, although any one had done penance in that way for a hundred 
            years, he would still not have known whether he had finished his penance. That meant forever to do penance
            and never to come to repentance.
        </li>
        <li>
            Here now the Holy See at Rome, coming to the aid of the poor Church, invented indulgences, whereby it 
            forgave and remitted satisfaction, first, for a single instance, for seven years, for a 
            hundred years and distributed them among the cardinals and bishops, so that one could grant indulgence for 
            a hundred years and another for a hundred days. But he reserved to himself alone the power to remit the 
            entire satisfaction.
        </li>
        <li>
            Now, since this began to yield money, and the traffic in bulls became profitable he devised the golden 
            jubilee year, and fixed it at Rome. He called this the remission of all 
            punishment and guilt. Then the people came running, because every one would fain have been freed from 
            this grievous, unbearable burden. This meant to find and raise the treasures of the earth. 
            Immediately the Pope pressed still further, and multiplied the golden years one upon another. But the
            more he devoured money, the wider grew his maw. Later, therefore, he issued them by his legates everywhere
            to the countries, until all churches and houses were full of the Golden Year.
        </li>
        <li>
            At last he also made an inroad into purgatory among the dead, first, by founding masses and vigils,
            afterwards, by indulgences and the Golden Year, and finally souls became so cheap that he released one 
            for a farthing.
        </li>
        <li>
            But all this, too, was of no avail. For although the Pope taught men to depend upon, and trust in, these 
            indulgences for salvation, yet he rendered the whole matter again uncertain. For in his bulls he 
            declares: Whoever would share in the indulgences or a Golden Year must be contrite, and have confessed, 
            and pay money. Now, we have heard above that this contrition and confession are with them uncertain and
            hypocrisy. Likewise, also no one knew what soul was in purgatory, and if some were therein, no one knew 
            which had properly repented and confessed. Thus he took the precious money, and comforted them meanwhile 
            with his power and indulgence, and directed them again to their uncertain work.
        </li>
        <li>
            If, now, there were some who did not believe themselves guilty of such actual 
            sins in thoughts, words, and works, as I, and such as I, in monasteries and chapters, 
            wished to be monks and priests, and by fasting, watching, praying, 
            saying Mass, coarse garments, and hard beds, etc., fought against evil thoughts, and in 
            full earnest and with force wanted to be holy, and yet the hereditary, inborn evil sometimes did in sleep 
            what it is wont to do (as also St. Augustine and Jerome among others confess), still each one held the 
            other in esteem, so that some, according to our teaching, were regarded as holy, without sin and full of 
            good works, so much so that with this mind we would communicate and sell our good works to others, as
            being superfluous to us for heaven. This is indeed true, and seals, letters, and instances that this 
            happened are at hand.
        </li>
        <li>
            When there were such, I say, these did not need repentance. For of what would they repent, since they 
            had not indulged wicked thoughts? What would they confess, since they had 
            avoided words? For what should they render satisfaction, since they were so guiltless of any deed that 
            they could even sell their superfluous righteousness to other poor sinners? Such saints were also the 
            Pharisees and scribes in the time of Christ.
        </li>
        <li>
            Here comes the fiery angel, St. John (Revelation 10), the true preacher of repentance, and with one 
            bolt hurls both those selling and those buying works on one heap, and says, "Repent!" (Matthew 3:2).
        </li>
        <li>
            Now, the poor wretches imagine, "Why, we have repented!" The rest say, "We need no repentance."
        </li>
        <li>
            John says: Repent ye, both of you, for ye are false penitents; so are these false saints, 
            and all of you on either side need the forgiveness of sins, because neither of you know what 
            true sin is not to say anything about your duty to repent of it and shun it. For no one of you is good; 
            you are full of unbelief, stupidity, and ignorance of God and God's will. For here He is present of whose 
            fullness have all we received, and grace for grace" (John 1:16), and: Without Him no man can be just before
            God. Therefore, if you wish to repent, repent aright; your penance is nothing. 
            And you hypocrites, who do not need repentance, you serpents' brood, who has assured you that
            you will escape the wrath to come? (Matthew 3:7; Luke 3:7).
        </li>
        <li>
            In the same way Paul also preaches, "There is none righteous, there is none that 
            understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God, there is none that doeth good, no not one; they are 
            all gone out of the way; they are together become unprofitable." (Romans 3:10-12).
        </li>
        <li>
            And, "God now commandeth all men everywhere to repent" (Acts 17:30). "All men," he says; no one excepted 
            who is a man.
        </li>
        <li>
            This repentance teaches us to discern sin, namely, that we are altogether lost, and that there is nothing 
            good in us from head to foot, and that we must absolutely become new and other men.
        </li>
        <li>
            This repentance is not partial and fragmentary, like that which does penance for 
            actual sins, nor is it uncertain like that. For it does not debate what is or is not sin, but hurls 
            everything on a heap, and says: All in us is nothing but sin. What is the use of 
            investigating, dividing, or distinguishing a long time? For this reason, too, this contrition is 
            not uncertain. For there is nothing left with which we can think of any good thing to pay 
            for sin, but there is only a sure despairing concerning all that we are, think, speak, or do, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
            In like manner confession, too, cannot be false, uncertain, or fragmentary. For
            he who confesses that all in him is nothing but sin comprehends all sins, excludes none, forgets none.
        </li>
        <li>
            Neither can the satisfaction be uncertain, because it is not our uncertain, sinful work, but it is the 
            suffering and blood of the innocent Lamb of God who taketh away the sin of the world.
        </li>
        <li>
            Of this repentance John preaches, and afterwards Christ in the Gospel, and we also. By this 
            repentance we dash to the ground the Pope and everything that is built upon our good works. For all is
            built upon a rotten and vain foundation, which is called a good work or law, even though no good work is 
            there, but only wicked works, and no one does the Law (as Christ, John 7:19, says), but all transgress it.
            Therefore the building that is raised upon it is nothing but falsehood and hypocrisy, even 
            where it is most holy and beautiful.
        </li>
        <li>
            And in Christians this repentance continues until death, because, through the entire life it contends with 
            sin remaining in the flesh, as Paul testifies that he wars with the law in his 
            members, etc. (Romans 7:14-25); and that, not by his own powers, but by the gift of the Holy Ghost 
            that follows the remission of sins. This gift daily cleanses and sweeps out the remaining sins, and 
            works so as to render man truly pure and holy.
        </li>
        <li>
            The Pope, the theologians, the jurists, and every other man know nothing of this from their own reason, 
            but it is a doctrine from heaven, revealed through the Gospel, and must suffer to be called heresy by the 
            godless saints.
        </li>
        <li>
            On the other hand, if certain sectarists would arise, some of whom are perhaps already extant, and in the 
            time of the insurrection of the peasants came to my own view, holding that all those who had once 
            received the Spirit or the forgiveness of sins, or had become believers, even though they should afterwards 
            sin, would still remain in the faith, and such sin would not harm them, and crying thus, "Do 
            whatever you please; if you believe, it all amounts to nothing; faith blots out all sins," etc. They say,
            besides, that if any one sins after he has received faith and the Spirit, he never truly had the Spirit
            and faith: I have had before me seen and heard many such insane men, and I fear that in some such a devil
            is still remaining.
        </li>
        <li>
            It is, accordingly, necessary to know and to teach that when holy men, still having and feeling original 
            sin, also daily repenting of and striving with it, happen to fall into manifest sins, as David into 
            adultery, murder, and blasphemy, that then faith and the Holy Ghost has departed from them. 
            For the Holy Ghost does not permit sin to have dominion, to gain the upper hand 
            so as to be accomplished, but represses and restrains it so that it must not do what it wishes. But if it 
            does what it wishes, the Holy Ghost and faith are certainly not present. For St. John says, 
            "Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin, ... and he cannot sin" (1 John 3:9). And yet it is also the 
            truth when the same St. John says, "If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is 
            not in us" (1 John 1:8).

    <h3>Of the Gospel</h3>
    <br />
    <ol>
        <li>
            We will now return to the Gospel, which not merely in one way gives us counsel and aid against sin; for 
            God is superabundantly rich in His grace and goodness. First, through the spoken Word by 
            which the forgiveness of sins is preached in the whole world; which is the 
            peculiar office of the Gospel. Secondly, through Baptism. Thirdly, through the holy Sacrament of the Altar.
            Fourthly, through the power of the keys, and also through the mutual conversation and consolation of 
            brethren: "Where two or three are gathered together" (Matthew 18:20), etc.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    
    <h2 id="Article3.5">Part III, Article V</h2>
    <h3>Of Baptism</h3>
    <br />
    <ol>
        <li>
            Baptism is nothing else than the Word of God in the water, commanded by His institution, or, as Paul 
            says, a washing in the Word; as also Augustine says, "Let the Word come to the element, and it becomes a 
            Sacrament."
        </li>
        <li>
            And for this reason we do not hold with Thomas and the monastic preachers who forget the 
            Word and say that God has imparted to the water a spiritual power, which through the 
            water washes away sin.
        </li>
        <li>
            Nor do we agree with Scotus and the Barefooted monks, who teach that, by 
            the assistance of the divine will, Baptism washes away sins, and that this ablution occurs only through the 
            will of God, and by no means through the Word or water.
        </li>
        <li>
            Of the baptism of children we hold that children ought to be baptized. For they belong to the promised 
            redemption made through Christ, and the Church should administer it to them.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    
    <h2 id="Article3.6">Part III, Article VI</h2>
    <h3>Of the Sacrament of the Altar</h3>
    <br />
    <ol>
        <li>
            Of the Sacrament of the Altar we hold that bread and wine in the Supper are the true body and blood of 
            Christ, and are given and received not only by the godly, but also by wicked Christians.
        </li>
        <li>
            And that not only one form is to be given. For we do not need that specious wisdom which is to
            teach us that under the one form there is as much as under both, as the sophists and the Council of 
            Constance teach.
        </li>
        <li>
            For even if it were true that there is as much under one as under both, yet the one form only is not the 
            entire ordinance and institution ordained and commanded by Christ.
        </li>
        <li>
            And we especially condemn and in God's name execrate those who not only omit both forms but also quite 
            tyrannically prohibit, condemn, and blaspheme them as heresy, and so exalt themselves 
            against and above Christ, our Lord and God, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
            As regards transubstantiation, we care nothing about the sophistical subtlety by which they teach that 
            bread and wine leave or lose their own natural substance, and that there remain only the appearance and 
            color of bread, and not true bread. For it is in perfect agreement with Holy Scriptures that there is, and 
            remains, bread, as Paul himself calls it, "The bread which we break" (1 Corinthians 10:16); and, "Let 
            him so eat of that bread" (1 Corinthians 11:28).
        </li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    
    <h2 id="Article3.7">Part III, Article VII</h2>
    <h3>Of the Keys</h3>
    <br />
    <ol>
        <li>
            The keys are an office and power given by Christ to the Church for binding and loosing sin, not only the 
            gross and well-known sins, but also the subtle, hidden, which are known only to God, as it is written, 
            "Who can understand his errors?" (Psalm 19:12). And in Romans 7:25, St. Paul himself complains that with 
            the flesh he serves the law of sin.
        </li>
        <li>
            For it is not in our power, but belongs to God alone, to judge which, how great, and how many the sins are, 
            as it is written, "Enter not into judgment with Thy servant; for in Thy sight shall no man 
            living be justified" (Psalm 143:2).
        </li>
        <li>
            And Paul says, "For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified" (1 Corinthians 4:4).
        </li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    
    <h2 id="Article3.8">Part III, Article VIII</h2>
    <h3>Of Confession</h3>
    <br />
    <ol>
        <li>
            Since Absolution or the Power of the Keys is also an aid and consolation against sin and a bad conscience, 
            ordained by Christ in the Gospel, Confession or Absolution ought by no means to be abolished in 
            the Church, especially on account of timid consciences and on account of the untrained 
            young people, in order that they may be examined, and instructed in the Christian doctrine.
        </li>
        <li>
            But the enumeration of sins ought to be free to every one, as to what he wishes to enumerate or not to 
            enumerate. For as long as we are in the flesh, we shall not lie when we say, "I am a poor man, 
            full of sin," and, "I see another law in my members" (Romans 7:23), etc. 
            For since private absolution originates in the Office of the Keys, it should not be neglected,
            but greatly and highly esteemed, as all other offices of the Christian Church.
        </li>
        <li>
            And in those things which concern the spoken, outward Word, we must firmly hold that God grants His 
            Spirit or grace to no one, except through or with the preceding outward Word, in order that we may
            be protected against the enthusiasts, i.e., spirits who boast that they have the Spirit without and before
            the Word, and accordingly judge Scripture or the spoken Word, and explain and stretch it at their pleasure,
            as Muenzer did, and many still do at the present day, who wish to be acute judges between the Spirit and 
            the letter, and yet know not what they say or declare.
        </li>
        <li>
            For indeed the Papacy also is nothing but sheer enthusiasm, by which the Pope boasts that all rights 
            exist in the shrine of his heart, and whatever he decides and commands within his church is spirit and
            right, even though it is above and contrary to Scripture and the spoken Word.
        </li>
        <li>
            All this is the old devil and old serpent, who also converted Adam and Eve into enthusiasts, and led them 
            from the outward Word of God to spiritualizing and self-conceit, and nevertheless he accomplished this 
            through other outward words.
        </li>
        <li>
            Just as also our enthusiasts at the present day condemn the outward Word, and nevertheless they 
            themselves are not silent, but they fill the world with their pratings and writings, as though, indeed, 
            the Spirit could not come through the writings and spoken word of the apostles, but through their 
            writings and words he must come. Why then do not they also omit their own sermons and writings, until 
            the Spirit Himself come to men, without their writings and before them, as they boast that He has come into 
            them without the preaching of the Scriptures? But of these matters there is not time now to dispute at 
            greater length; we have elsewhere sufficiently urged this subject.
        </li>
        <li>
            For even those who believe before Baptism, or become believing in Baptism, believe through the preceding
            outward Word, as the adults, who have come to reason, must first have heard: He that believeth and is 
            baptized shall be saved, even though they are at first unbelieving, and receive the Spirit and Baptism ten
            years afterwards.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cornelius, in Acts 10:1, had heard long before among the Jews of the coming Messiah, through whom he was 
            righteous before God, and in such faith his prayers and alms were acceptable to God (as Luke calls him 
            devout and God-fearing), and without such preceding Word and hearing could not have believed or been 
            righteous. But St. Peter had to reveal to him that the Messiah (in whom, as one that was to come, he had
            hitherto believed) now had come, lest his faith concerning the coming Messiah hold him captive among the 
            hardened and unbelieving Jews, but know that he was now to be saved by the present Messiah, and must not,
            with the Jews deny nor persecute Him.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a word, enthusiasm inheres in Adam and his children from the beginning to the end 
            of the world, its poison having been implanted and infused into them by the old dragon, and is the 
            origin, power, and strength of all heresy, especially of that of the Papacy and Mohammad.
        </li>
        <li>
            Therefore we ought and must constantly maintain this point, that God does not wish to deal with us 
            otherwise than through the spoken Word and the Sacraments.
        </li>
        <li>
            It is the devil himself whatsoever is extolled as Spirit without the Word and Sacraments. For God wished 
            to appear even to Moses through the burning bush and spoken Word; and no prophet neither Elijah nor Elisha,
            received the Spirit without the Ten Commandments.
        </li>
        <li>
            Neither was John the Baptist conceived without the preceding word of Gabriel, nor did he leap in his
            mother's womb without the voice of Mary.
        </li>
        <li>
            And Peter says, "The prophecy came not by the will of man; but holy men of God spake as they 
            were moved by the Holy Ghost" (2 Peter 1:21). Without the outward Word, however, they were not holy, 
            much less would the Holy Ghost have moved them to speak when they still were unholy; for they were holy, 
            says he, since the Holy Ghost spake through them.

    <h3>Of Excommunication</h3>
    <br />
    <ol>
        <li>
            The greater excommunication, as the Pope calls it, we regard only as a civil penalty, and it does not
            concern us ministers of the Church. But the lesser, that is, the true Christian excommunication, consists 
            in this, that manifest and obstinate sinners are not admitted to the Sacrament and other communion of the
            Church until they amend their lives and avoid sin. And ministers ought not to mingle secular punishments 
            with this ecclesiastical punishment, or excommunication.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    
    <h2 id="Article3.10">Part III, Article X</h2>
    <h3>Of Ordination and the Call</h3>
    <br />
    <ol>
        <li>
            If the bishops would be true bishops, and would devote themselves 
            to the Church and the Gospel, it might be granted to them for the sake of love and unity, but not from 
            necessity, to ordain and confirm us and our preachers; omitting, however, all comedies and spectacular
            display of unchristian parade and pomp.
        </li>
        <li>
            But because they neither are, nor wish to be, true bishops, but worldly lords and princes, who will 
            neither preach, nor teach, nor baptize, nor administer the Lord's Supper, nor perform any work or office
            of the Church, and, moreover, persecute and condemn those who discharge these functions, having been 
            called to do so, the Church ought not on their account to remain without ministers.
        </li>
        <li>
            Therefore, as the ancient examples of the Church and the Fathers teach us, we ourselves will and ought to 
            ordain suitable persons to this office; and, even according to their own laws, they have not the right to 
            forbid or prevent us. For their laws say that those ordained even by heretics should be declared truly 
            ordained and stay ordained, <a href="/Content/Letters/JeromeToEvangelus2">as St. Jerome writes</a>
            of the Church at Alexandria, that at first it was 
            governed in common by priests and preachers, without bishops.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    
    <h2 id="Article3.11">Part III, Article XI</h2>
    <h3>Of the Marriage of Prists</h3>
    <br />
    <ol>
        <li>
            To prohibit marriage, and to burden the divine order of priests with perpetual celibacy, they have had 
            neither authority nor right, but have acted like antichristian, tyrannical, desperate scoundrels, and have 
            thereby caused all kinds of horrible, abominable, innumerable sins of unchastity, in which they still 
            wallow.
        </li>
        <li>
            Now, as little as we or they have been given the power to make a woman out of a man or a man out of a 
            woman, or to nullify either sex, so little have they had the power to separate such creatures
            of God, or to forbid them from living honestly in marriage with one another.
        </li>
        <li>
            Therefore we are unwilling to assent to their abominable celibacy, nor will we even tolerate it, but we
            wish to have marriage free as God has instituted it, and we wish neither to rescind nor 
            hinder His work; for Paul says that this prohibition of marriage is a doctrine of devils (1 Timothy 4:1).
        </li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    
    <h2 id="Article3.12">Part III, Article XII</h2>
    <h3>Of the Church</h3>
    <br />
    <ol>
        <li>
            We do not concede to them that they are the Church, and in truth they are not the Church; nor will we 
            listen to those things which, under the name of Church, they enjoin or forbid.
        </li>
        <li>
            For, thank God, today a child seven years old knows what the Church is, namely, the holy believers and 
            lambs who hear the voice of their Shepherd. For the children pray thus: I believe in one holy
            Christian Church.
        </li>
        <li>
            This holiness does not consist in albs, tonsures, long gowns, and other of their ceremonies devised by them 
            beyond Holy Scripture, but in the Word of God and true faith.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    
    <h2 id="Article3.13">Part III, Article XIII</h2>
    <h3>How One is Justified Before God, and of Good Works</h3>
    <br />
    <ol>
        <li>
            What I have hitherto and constantly taught concerning this I know not how to change in the least, namely, 
            that by faith, as St. Peter says, we acquire a new and clean heart, and God will and does account us 
            entirely righteous and holy for the sake of Christ, our Mediator. And although sin in the flesh has not yet
            been altogether removed or become dead, yet He will not punish or remember it.
        </li>
        <li>
            And such faith, renewal, and forgiveness of sins is followed by good works. And what there is still sinful 
            or imperfect also in them shall not be accounted as sin or defect, even for Christ's sake;
            but the entire man, both as to his person and his works, is to be called and to be righteous and holy from 
            pure grace and mercy, shed upon us and spread over us in Christ.
        </li>
        <li>
            Therefore we cannot boast of many merits and works, if they are viewed apart from grace and mercy, but as
            it is written, "He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord, namely, that he has a gracious 
            God" (1 Corinthians 1:31). For thus all is well.
        </li>
        <li>
            We say, besides, that if good works do not follow, faith is false and not true.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    
    <h2 id="Article3.14">Part III, Article XIV</h2>
    <h3>Of Monastic Vows</h3>
    <br />
    <ol>
        <li>
            As monastic vows directly conflict with the first chief article, they must be absolutely abolished. For it 
            is of them that Christ says, "I am Christ" (Matthew 24:5, 23), etc.
        </li>
        <li>
            For he who makes a vow to live as a monk believes that he will enter upon a mode of life holier than 
            ordinary Christians lead, and wishes to earn heaven by his own works not only for himself, but also for 
            others; this is to deny Christ.
        </li>
        <li>
            And they boast from their St. Thomas that a monastic vow is equal to Baptism. This is blasphemy.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    
    <h2 id="Article3.15">Part III, Article XV</h2>
    <h3>Of Human Tradition</h3>
    <br />
    <ol>
        <li>
            The declaration of the Papists that human traditions serve for the remission of sins, or merit salvation, 
            is altogether unchristian and condemned, as Christ says, "In vain they do worship Me, teaching 
            for doctrines the commandments of men" (Matthew 15:9).
        </li>
        <li>
            Again, "That turn from the truth" (Titus 1:14). Again, when they declare that it is a mortal sin if one 
            breaks these ordinances, this, too, is not right.
        </li>
        <li>
            These are the articles on which I must stand, and, God willing, shall stand even to my death; and I do not 
            know how to change or to yield anything in them. If any one wishes to yield anything, let him do it at the 
            peril of his conscience.
        </li>
        <li>
            Lastly, there still remains the Pope's bag of impostures concerning foolish and childish articles, as, the 
            dedication of churches, the baptism of bells, the baptism of the altarstone, and the inviting of sponsors 
            to these rites, who would make donations towards them. Such baptizing is a reproach and mockery of Holy 
            Baptism, hence should not be tolerated.
        </li>
        <li>
            Furthermore, concerning the consecration of wax-tapers, palm-branches, cakes, oats, spices, etc., 
            which indeed, cannot be called consecrations, but are sheer mockery and fraud. And such deceptions there
            are without number, which we commend for adoration to their god and to themselves, until they weary of it.
            We will have nothing to do with them.
        </li>
