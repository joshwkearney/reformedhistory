    <h2>The Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed</h2>
    <h3>As Written and Ratified by the Council</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth,
        and of all things visible and invisible. And in one Lord Jesus Christ,
        the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of his Father before all worlds,
        Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten not made, being of one
        substance with the Father, by whom all things were made. Who for us men
        and for our salvation came down from heaven and was incarnate by the
        Holy Ghost and the Virgin Mary, and was made man, and was crucified also
        for us under Pontius Pilate. He suffered and was buried, and the third
        day he rose again according to the Scriptures, and ascended into heaven,
        and sits at the Right Hand of the Father. And he shall come again
        with glory to judge both the quick and the dead, whose kingdom shall
        have no end.
        <br /><br />

        And we believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver-of-Life, who
        proceeds from the Father, who with the Father and the Son together is
        worshipped and glorified, who spoke by the prophets. And we believe in
        one, holy, catholic and apostolic church. We acknowledge one
        Baptism for the remission of sins, and we look for the resurrection of
        the dead and the life of the world to come. 
        <br /><br />
        
        Amen.

    <h2 id="LetterToTheEmperor">A Letter to the Most Pious Emperor Theodosius the Great</h2>
    <h3>From the Holy Synod Assembled at Constantinople</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        To the most religious Emperor Theodosius, the Holy Synod of Bishops
        assembled in Constantinople out of different Provinces, 
        <br /><br />
        
        We begin our
        letter to your Piety with thanks to God, who has established the empire
        of your Piety for the common peace of the Churches and for the support
        of the true Faith. And, after rendering due thanks unto God, as in duty
        bound we lay before your Piety the things which have been done in the
        Holy Synod.
        <br /><br />
        
        When, then, we had assembled in Constantinople, according to
        the letter of your Piety, we first of all renewed our unity of heart
        each with the other, and then we pronounced some concise definitions,
        ratifying the Faith of the Nicene Fathers, and anathematizing the
        heresies which have sprung up, contrary thereto. Besides these things,
        we also framed certain Canons for the better ordering of the Churches,
        all which we have subjoined to this our letter. Wherefore we beseech
        your Piety that the decree of the Synod may be ratified, to the end
        that, as you have honoured the Church by your letter of citation, so you
        should set your seal to the conclusion of what has been decreed.
        <br /><br />
        
        May the
        Lord establish your empire in peace and righteousness, and prolong it
        from generation to generation; and may he add unto your earthly power
        the fruition of the heavenly kingdom also. May God by the prayers
        of the Saints, show favour to the world, that you may be strong and eminent
        in all good things as an Emperor most truly pious and beloved of God.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Canon1">Canon 1</h2>
    <h3>Of the Heresies</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        The Faith of the Three Hundred and Eighteen Fathers assembled at Nicea in
        Bithynia shall not be set aside, but shall remain firm. And every heresy
        shall be anathematized, particularly that of the Eunomians,
        the Anomoeans, the Arians, the Eudoxians, and that of the Semi-Arians or
        Pneumatomachi, and that of the Sabellians, and that of the Marcellians,
        and that of the Photinians, and that of the Apollinarians.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Canon2">Canon 2</h2>
    <h3>Of the Jurisdiction of Bishops</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        The bishops are not to go beyond their dioceses to churches lying
        outside of their bounds, nor bring confusion on the churches; but let
        the Bishop of Alexandria, according to the canons, alone administer the
        affairs of Egypt; and let the bishops of the East manage the East alone,
        the privileges of the Church in Antioch, which are mentioned in the
        canons of Nicea, being preserved; and let the bishops of the Asian
        Diocese administer the Asian affairs only; and the Pontic bishops only
        Pontic matters; and the Thracian bishops only Thracian affairs. And let
        not bishops go beyond their dioceses for ordination or any other
        ecclesiastical ministrations, unless they be invited. And the aforesaid
        canon concerning dioceses being observed, it is evident that the
        synod of every province will administer the affairs of that particular
        province as was decreed at Nice. But the Churches of God in heathen
        nations must be governed according to the custom which has prevailed
        from the times of the Fathers.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Canon3">Canon 3</h2>
    <h3>Of the Honor of Constantinople</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        The Bishop of Constantinople, however, shall have the prerogative of
        honour after the Bishop of Rome; because Constantinople is New Rome.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Canon4">Canon 4</h2>
    <h3>Of Maximus the Cynic</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        Concerning Maximus the Cynic and the disorder which has happened in
        Constantinople on his account, it is decreed that Maximus never was and
        is not now a Bishop; that those who have been ordained by him are in no
        order whatever of the clergy; since all which has been done concerning
        him or by him, is declared to be invalid.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="SynodalLetter">The Synodal Letter</h2>
    <h3>Of the Holy Fathers Assembled at Constantinople</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        To the right honorable lords our right reverend brethren and
        colleagues, Damasus, Ambrosius, Britton, Valerianus, Ascholius, Anemius,
        Basilius and the rest of the holy bishops assembled in the great city of
        Rome, the holy synod of the orthodox bishops assembled at the great city
        of Constantinople sends greeting in the Lord.
        <br /><br />

        To recount all the sufferings inflicted on us by the power of the
        Arians, and to attempt to give information to your reverences, as though
        you were not already well acquainted with them, might seem superfluous.
        For we do not suppose your piety to hold what is befalling us as of such
        secondary importance as that you stand in any need of information on
        matters which cannot but evoke your sympathy.
        <br /><br />

        Nor indeed were the storms
        which beset us such as to escape notice from their insignificance. Our
        persecutions are but of yesterday. The sound of them still rings in the
        ears alike of those who suffered them and of those whose love made the
        sufferers' pain their own. It was but a day or two ago, so to speak,
        that some released from chains in foreign lands returned to their own
        churches through manifold afflictions; of others who had died in exile
        the relics were brought home; others again, even after their return from
        exile, found the passion of the heretics still at the boiling heat, and,
        slain by them with stones as was the blessed Stephen, met with a sadder
        fate in their own than in a stranger's land. Others, worn away with
        various cruelties, still bear in their bodies the scars of their wounds
        and the marks of Christ.
        <br /><br />

        Who could tell the tale of fines, of
        disfranchisements, of individual confiscations, of intrigues, of
        outrages, of prisons? In truth all kinds of tribulation were wrought out
        beyond number in us, perhaps because we were paying the penalty of sins,
        perhaps because the merciful God was trying us by means of the multitude
        of our sufferings. For these all thanks to God, who by means of such
        afflictions trained his servants and, according to the multitude of his
        mercies, brought us again to refreshment. We indeed needed long leisure,
        time, and toil to restore the church once more, that so, like physicians
        healing the body after long sickness and expelling its disease by
        gradual treatment, we might bring her back to her ancient health of true
        religion.
        <br /><br />

        It is true that on the whole we seem to have been delivered
        from the violence of our persecutions and to be just now recovering the
        churches which, have for a long time been the prey of the heretics. But
        wolves are troublesome to us who, though they have been driven from the
        fold, yet harry the flock up and down the glades, daring to hold rival
        assemblies, stirring seditious among the people, and shrinking from
        nothing which can do damage to the churches. So, as we have already
        said, we must labour all the longer.
        <br /><br />

        Since, however, you showed
        your brotherly love to us by inviting us (as though we were your own
        members) by the letters of our most religious emperor to the synod which
        you are gathering by divine permission at Rome, to the end that since we
        alone were then condemned to suffer persecution, you should not now,
        when our emperors are at one with us as to true religion, reign apart
        from us; but our prayer was that we, to use the Apostle's phrase, should
        reign with you, if it were possible, all in company to leave our
        churches, and rather gratify our longing to see you than consult their
        needs. For who will give us wings as of a dove, and we will fly and be
        at rest? But this course seemed likely to leave the churches who were
        just recovering quite uncle-fended, and the undertaking was to most of
        us impossible; for, in accordance with the letters sent a year ago from
        your holiness after the synod at Aquileia to the most pious emperor
        Theodosius, we had journeyed to Constantinople, equipped only for
        travelling so far as Constantinople, and bringing the consent of the
        bishops remaining in the provinces of this synod alone.
        <br /><br />

        We had been in no
        expectation of any longer journey nor had heard a word about it, before
        our arrival at Constantinople. In addition to all this, and on account
        of the narrow limits of the appointed time which allowed of no
        preparation for a longer journey, nor of communicating with the bishops
        of our communion in the provinces and of obtaining their consent, the
        journey to Rome was for the majority impossible. We have therefore
        adopted the next best course open to us under the circumstances, both
        for the better administration of the church, and for manifesting our
        love towards you, by strongly urging our most venerated, and honoured
        colleagues and brother bishops Cyriacus, Eusebius and Priscianus, to
        consent to travel to you.
        <br /><br />

        Through them we wish to make it plain that our disposition is all for
        peace with unity for its sole object, and that we are full of zeal for
        the right faith. For we, whether we suffered persecutions, or
        afflictions, or the threats of emperors, or the cruelties of princes,
        or any other trial at the hands of heretics, have undergone all for the
        sake of the evangelic faith, ratified by the three hundred and eighteen
        fathers at Nicaea in Bithynia. This is the faith which ought to be
        sufficient for you, for us, for all who wrest not the word of the true
        faith; for it is the ancient faith; it is the faith of our baptism; it
        is the faith that teaches us to believe in the name of the Father, of
        the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.
        <br /><br />

        According to this faith there is one
        Godhead, Power and Substance of the Father and of the Son and of the
        Holy Ghost; the dignity being equal, and the majesty being equal in
        three perfect hypostases (i.e. three perfect persons). Thus there is no
        room for the heresy of Sabellius by the confusion of the hypostases
        (i.e. the destruction of the personalities); thus the blasphemy of the
        Eunomians, of the Arians, and of the Pneumatomachi is nullified, which
        divides the substance, the nature, and the godhead, and super-induces on
        the uncreated consubstantial and co-eternal Trinity a nature posterior,
        created and of a different substance.
        <br /><br />

        We moreover preserve unperverted
        the doctrine of the incarnation of the Lord, holding the tradition that
        the dispensation of the flesh is neither soulless nor mindless nor
        imperfect; and knowing full well that God's Word was perfect before the
        ages, and became perfect man in the last days for our salvation.
        <br /><br />

        Let this suffice for a summary of the doctrine which is fearlessly and
        frankly preached by us, and concerning which you will be able to be
        still further satisfied if you will deign to read the tome of the synod
        of Antioch, and also that tome issued last year by the Ecumenical
        Council held at Constantinople, in which we have set forth our
        confession of the faith at greater length, and have appended an anathema
        against the heresies which innovators have recently inscribed.
        <br /><br />

        Now as to the particular administration of individual churches, an
        ancient custom, as you know, has obtained, confirmed by the enactment of
        the holy fathers of Nicaea, that in every province, the bishops of the
        province, and, with their consent, the neighbouring bishops with them,
        should perform ordinations as expediency may require. In conforming with
        these customs note that other churches have been administered by us and
        the priests of the most famous churches publicly appointed.
        <br /><br />

        Accordingly
        over the new made (if the expression be allowable) church at
        Constantinople, which, as through from a lion's mouth, we have lately
        snatched by God's mercy from the blasphemy of the heretics, we have ordained
        bishop the right reverend and most religious Nectarius, in the
        presence of the Ecumenical Council, with common consent, before the most
        religious emperor Theodosius, and with the assent of all the clergy and
        of the whole city.
        <br /><br />

        And over the most ancient and truly apostolic church
        in Syria, where first the noble name of Christians was given them, the
        bishops of the province and of the eastern diocese have met together and
        canonically ordained bishop the right reverend and most religious
        Flavianus, with the consent of all the church, who as though with one
        voice joined in expressing their respect for him. This rightful
        ordination also received the sanction of the General Council.
        <br /><br />

        Of the
        church at Jerusalem, mother of all the churches, we make known that the
        right reverend and most religious Cyril is bishop, who was some time ago
        canonically ordained by the bishops of the province, and has in several
        places fought a good fight against the Arians.
        <br /><br />

        We beseech your reverence
        to rejoice at what has thus been rightly and canonically settled by us,
        by the intervention of spiritual love and by the influence of the fear
        of the Lord, compelling the feelings of men, and making the edification
        of churches of more importance than individual grace or favor. Thus
        since among us there is agreement in the faith and Christian charity has
        been established, we shall cease to use the phrase condemned by the
        apostles, "I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas," and all
        appearing as Christ's, who in us is not divided, by God's grace we will
        keep the body of the church unrent, and will boldly stand at the
        judgment seat of the Lord.
    </p>
