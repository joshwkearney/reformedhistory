    <h2>The Nicean Creed</h2>
    <h3>As Written and Ratified by the Council</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of all things
        visible and invisible; and in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the
        only-begotten of his Father, of the substance of the Father, God of
        God, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made,
        being of one substance with the Father. By whom all things were made,
        both which be in heaven and in earth. Who for us men and for our
        salvation came down from heaven and was incarnate and was made
        man. He suffered and the third day he rose again, and ascended into
        heaven. And he shall come again to judge both the quick and the dead.
        And we believe in the Holy Ghost.
        <br /><br />

        And whosoever shall say that
        there was a time when the Son of God was not, or that before he was begotten
        he was not, or that he was made of things that were not, or that he is of
        a different substance or essence from the Father, or that he is a
        creature, or subject to change or conversionâ€”all that so say, the
        Catholic and Apostolic Church anathematizes them.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="SynodalLetter">The Synodal Letter</h2>
    <h3>Of the Holy and Great Synod of Nicea</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        To the Church of Alexandria, by the grace of God, holy and great;
        and to our well-beloved brethren, the orthodox clergy and laity
        throughout Egypt, and Pentapolis, and Lybia, and every nation under
        heaven, the holy and great synod, the bishops assembled at Nicea,
        wish health in the Lord.
        <br /><br />

        Forasmuch as the great and holy Synod, which was assembled at
        Niece through the grace of Christ and our most religious Sovereign
        Constantine, who brought us together from our several provinces and
        cities, has considered matters which concern the faith of the Church, it
        seemed to us to be necessary that certain things should be
        communicated from us to you in writing, so that you might have the
        means of knowing what has been mooted and investigated, and also
        what has been decreed and confirmed.
        <br /><br />

        First of all, then, in the presence of our most religious Sovereign
        Constantine, investigation was made of matters concerning the impiety
        and transgression of Arius and his adherents; and it was unanimously
        decreed that he and his impious opinion should be anathematized,
        together with the blasphemous words and speculations in which he
        indulged, blaspheming the Son of God, and saying that He is from
        things that are not, and that before He was begotten He was not, and
        that there was a time when He was not, and that the Son of God is by
        his free will capable of vice and virtue; saying also that He is a
        creature. All these things the holy Synod has anathematized, not even
        enduring to hear his impious doctrine and madness and blasphemous
        words. And of the charges against him and of the results they had, you
        have either already heard or will hear the particulars, lest we should
        seem to be oppressing a man who has in fact received a fitting
        recompense for his own sin. So far indeed has his impiety prevailed,
        that he has even destroyed Theonas of Marmorica and Secundes of
        Ptolemais; for they also have received the same sentence as the rest.
        <br /><br />

        But when the grace of God had delivered Egypt from that heresy and
        blasphemy, and from the persons who have dared to make disturbance
        and division among a people heretofore at peace, there remained the
        matter of the insolence of Meletius and those who have been ordained
        by him; and concerning this part of our work we now, beloved
        brethren, proceed to inform you of the decrees of the Synod. The
        Synod, then, being disposed to deal gently with Meletius (for in strict
        justice he deserved no leniency), decreed that he should remain in his
        own city, but have no authority either to ordain, or to administer
        affairs, or to make appointments; and that he should not appear in the
        country or in any other city for this purpose, but should enjoy the bare
        title of his rank; but that those who have been placed by him, after they
        have been confirmed by a more sacred laying on of hands, shall on
        these conditions be admitted to communion: that they shall both have
        their rank and the right to officiate, but that they shall be altogether the
        inferiors of all those who are enrolled in any church or parish, and
        have been appointed by our most honourable colleague Alexander. 
        <br /><br />
        So
        that these men are to have no authority to make appointments of
        persons who may be pleasing to them, nor to suggest names, nor to do
        anything whatever, without  the consent of the bishops of the Catholic
        and Apostolic Church, who are serving under our most holy colleague
        Alexander; while those who, by the grace of God and through your
        prayers, have been found in no schism, but on the contrary are without
        spot in the Catholic and Apostolic Church, are to have authority to
        make appointments and nominations of worthy persons among the
        clergy, and in short to do all things according to the law and ordinance
        of the Church. But, if it happen that any of the clergy who are now in
        the Church should die, then those who have been lately received are to
        succeed to the office of the deceased; always provided that they shall
        appear to be worthy, and that the people elect them, and that the
        bishop of Alexandria shall concur in the election and ratify it. This
        concession has been made to all the rest; but, on account of his
        disorderly conduct from the first, and the rashness and precipitation of
        his character, the same decree was not
        made concerning Meletius himself, but that, inasmuch as he is a man
        capable of committing again the same disorders, no authority nor
        privilege should be conceded to him.
        <br /><br />

        These are the particulars, which are of special interest to Egypt and to
        the most holy Church of Alexandria; but if in the presence of our most
        honoured lord, our colleague and brother Alexander, anything else has
        been enacted by canon or other decree, he will himself convey it to
        you in greater detail, he having been both a guide and fellow-worker in
        what has been done.
        <br /><br />

        We further proclaim to you the good news of the agreement
        concerning the holy Easter, that this particular also has through your
        prayers been rightly settled; so that all our brethren in the East who
        formerly followed the custom of the Jews are henceforth to celebrate
        the said most sacred feast of Easter at the same time with the Romans
        and yourselves and all those who have observed Easter from the
        beginning.
        <br /><br />

        Wherefore, rejoicing in these wholesome results, and in our common
        peace and harmony, and in the cutting off of every heresy, receive
        with the greater honour and with increased love, our colleague your
        Bishop Alexander, who has gladdened us by his presence, and who at
        so great an age has undergone so great fatigue that peace might be
        established among you and all of us. Pray ye also for us all, that the
        things which have been deemed advisable may stand fast; for they
        have been done, as we believe, to the well-pleasing of Almighty God
        and of his only Begotten Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, and of the Holy
        Ghost, to whom be glory forever.
        <br /><br />
        
        Amen.
    </p>
    <br />
    
    <h2 id="OnEaster">On the Date of Easter</h2>
    <h3>From the Letter of the Emperor to All Those Not Present at the Council</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        When the question relative to the sacred festival of Easter arose, it was
        universally thought that it would be convenient that all should keep the
        feast on one day; for what could be more beautiful and more desirable,
        than to see this festival, through which we receive the hope of
        immortality, celebrated by all with one accord, and in the same
        manner? 
        <br /><br />
        
        It was declared to be particularly unworthy for this, the
        holiest of all festivals, to follow the custom of the
        Jews, who had soiled their hands with the most fearful of crimes, and
        whose minds were blinded. In rejecting their custom, we may
        transmit to our descendants the legitimate mode of celebrating Easter,
        which we have observed from the time of the Saviour's Passion to the
        present day according to the day of the week.
        <br /><br />
        
        We ought not,
        therefore, to have anything in common with the Jews, for the Saviour
        has shown us another way; our worship follows a more legitimate and
        more convenient course; and
        consequently, in unanimously adopting this mode, we desire, dearest
        brethren, to separate ourselves from the detestable company of the
        Jews, for it is truly shameful for us to hear them boast that without
        their direction we could not keep this feast. How can they be in the
        right, they who, after the death of the Saviour, have no longer been led
        by reason but by wild violence, as their delusion may urge them?
        <br /><br />
        
        They
        do not possess the truth in this Easter question; for, in their blindness
        and repugnance to all improvements, they frequently celebrate two
        passovers in the same year. We could not imitate those who are openly
        in error. How, then, could we follow these Jews, who are most
        certainly blinded by error? for to celebrate the passover twice in one
        year is totally inadmissible. But even if this were not so, it would still
        be your duty not to tarnish your soul by communications with such
        wicked people.
        <br /><br />
        
        Besides, consider well, that in such an
        important matter, and on a subject of such great solemnity, there ought
        not to be any division. Our Saviour has left us only one festal day of
        our redemption, that is to say, of his holy passion, and he desired to
        establish only one Catholic Church. Think, then, how unseemly it is,
        that on the same day some should be fasting while others are seated
        at a banquet; and that after Easter, some should be rejoicing at feasts,
        whilst others are still observing a strict fast.
        <br /><br />
        
        For this reason, a Divine
        Providence wills that this custom should be rectified and regulated in a
        uniform way; and everyone, I hope, will agree upon this point. As, on
        the one hand, it is our duty not to have anything in common with the
        murderers of our Lord; and as, on the other, the custom now followed
        by the Churches of the West, of the South, and of
        the North, and by some of those of the East, is the most acceptable, it
        has appeared good to all; and I have been guaranteed for your consent,
        that you would accept it with joy, as it is followed at Rome, in Africa,
        in all Italy, Egypt, Spain, Gaul, Britain, Libya, in all Achaia, and in the
        dioceses of Asia, of Pontus, and Cilicia.
        <br /><br />
        
        You should consider not only
        that the number of churches in these provinces make a majority, but
        also that it is right to demand what our reason approves, and that we
        should have nothing in common with the Jews. To sum up in few
        words: By the unanimous judgment of all, it has been decided that the
        most holy festival of Easter should be everywhere celebrated on one
        and the same day, and it is not seemly that in so holy a thing there
        should be any division. As this is the state of the case, accept joyfully
        the divine favour, and this truly divine command; for all which takes
        place in assemblies of the bishops ought to be regarded as proceeding
        from the will of God.
        <br /><br />
        
        Make known to your brethren what has been
        decreed, keep this most holy day according to the prescribed mode; we
        can thus celebrate this holy Easter day at the same time, if it is granted
        me, as I desire, to unite myself with you; we can rejoice together,
        seeing that the divine power has made use of our instrumentality for
        destroying the evil designs of the devil, and thus causing faith, peace,
        and unity to flourish amongst us. May God graciously protect you, my
        beloved brethren.
    </p>

    <h3>Of Castration</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        If any one in sickness has been subjected by physicians to a surgical
        operation, or if he has been castrated by barbarians, let him remain
        among the clergy; but, if any one in sound health has castrated
        himself, it behoves that such a one, if already enrolled among the
        clergy, should cease from his ministry, and that from henceforth no
        such person should be promoted. But, as it is evident that this is said
        of those who willfully do the thing and presume to castrate themselves,
        so if any have been made eunuchs by barbarians, or by their masters,
        and should otherwise be found worthy, such men the Canon admits to
        the clergy.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Canon2">Canon 2</h2>
    <h3>Of the Presbyterate</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        Forasmuch as, either from necessity, or through the urgency of
        individuals, many things have been done contrary to the Ecclesiastical
        canon so that men just converted from heathenism to the faith, and
        who have been instructed but a little while, are straightway brought to
        the spiritual layer, and as soon as they have been baptized are
        advanced to the episcopate or the presbyterate. It has seemed right to
        us that for the time to come no such thing shall be done. 
        <br /><br />
        
        For to the
        catechumen himself there is need of time and of a longer trial after
        baptism. For the apostolical saying is clear, "Not a novice; lest, being
        lifted up with pride, he fall into condemnation and the snare of the
        devil." But if, as time goes on, any sensual sin should be found out
        about the person, and he should be convicted by two or three
        witnesses, let him cease from the clerical office. And whoso shall
        transgress this legislation will imperil his own clerical position as
        a person who presumes to disobey the great Synod.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Canon3">Canon 3</h2>
    <h3>Of Female Companions</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        The great Synod has stringently forbidden any bishop, presbyter,
        deacon, or any one of the clergy whatever, to have a (non-spouse) 
        female companion dwelling with him, except only a mother, 
        or sister, or aunt, or such
        persons only as are beyond all suspicion.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Canon4">Canon 4</h2>
    <h3>Of Ordination</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        It is by all means proper that a bishop should be appointed by all the
        bishops in the province; but should this be difficult, either on account
        of urgent necessity or because of distance, three at least should meet
        together, the suffrages of the absent bishops also being given and
        communicated in writing, then the ordination should take place. But in
        every province the ratification of what is done should be left to the
        Metropolitan.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Canon5">Canon 5</h2>
    <h3>Of Excommunication</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        Concerning those, whether of the clergy or of the laity, who have
        been excommunicated in the several provinces, let the provision of the
        canon be observed by the bishops which provides that persons cast out
        by some be not readmitted by others. Nevertheless, inquiry should be
        made whether they have been excommunicated through captiousness,
        or contentiousness, or any such like ungracious disposition in the
        bishop. 
        <br /><br />
        
        And, that this matter may have due investigation, it is decreed
        that in every province synods shall be held twice a year, in order that
        when all the bishops of the province are assembled together, such
        questions may be thoroughly examined, so that those who
        have confessedly offended against their bishop may be seen by all to
        be excommunicated, until it shall seem fit to a general
        meeting of the bishops to pronounce a milder sentence upon them.
        <br /><br />
        
        And let these synods be held, the one before Lent (that the pure Gift
        may be offered to God after all bitterness has been put away), and let
        the second be held about autumn.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Canon6">Canon 6</h2>
    <h3>Of Alexandria</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        Let the ancient customs in Egypt, Libya, and Pentapolis prevail, that
        the Bishop of Alexandria have jurisdiction in all these, since the like is
        customary for the Bishop of Rome also. Likewise in Antioch and the
        other provinces let the Churches retain their privileges. And this is to
        be universally understood, that if anyone be made bishop without the
        consent of the Metropolitan, the great Synod has declared that such a
        man ought not to be a bishop. If, however, two or three bishops shall
        from natural love of contradiction, oppose the common suffrage of the
        rest, it being reasonable and in accordance with the ecclesiastical law,
        then let the choice of the majority prevail.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Canon7">Canon 7</h2>
    <h3>Of Jerusalem</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        Since custom and ancient tradition have prevailed that the Bishop of
        Jerusalem should be honoured, let him, saving its due
        dignity to the Metropolis, have the next place of honour.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Canon8">Canon 8</h2>
    <h3>Of the Cathari</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        Concerning those who call themselves Cathari, if they come over
        to the Catholic and Apostolic Church, the great and holy Synod
        decrees that they who are ordained shall continue as they are in the
        clergy. But it is before all things necessary that they should profess in
        writing that they will observe and follow the dogmas of the Catholic
        and Apostolic Church; in particular that they will communicate with
        persons who have been twice married, and with those who having
        lapsed in persecution have had a period of penance laid upon them,
        and a time of restoration fixed so that in all
        things they will follow the dogmas of the Catholic Church.
        <br /><br />
        
        Wheresoever, then, whether in villages or in cities, all of the ordained
        are found to be of these only, let them remain in the clergy, and in the
        same rank in which they are found. But if they come over where there
        is a bishop or presbyter of the Catholic Church, it is manifest that the
        Bishop of the Church must have the bishop's dignity; and he who was
        named bishop by those who are called Cathari shall have the rank of
        presbyter, unless it shall seem fit to the Bishop to admit him to partake
        in the honour of the title. Or, if this should not be satisfactory, then
        the bishop shall provide for him a place as Chorepiscopus, or
        presbyter, in order that he may be evidently seen to be of the clergy,
        and that there may not be two bishops in the city.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Canon9">Canon 9</h2>
    <h3>Of Invalid Ordination</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        If any presbyters have been advanced without examination, or if upon
        examination they have made confession of crime (or men acting in
        violation of the canon have laid hands upon them), notwithstanding
        their confession, such the canon does not admit; for the Catholic
        Church requires that which is blameless.

    <h3>Of Lapsed Ordination</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        If any who have lapsed have been ordained through the ignorance, or
        even with the previous knowledge of the ordainers, this shall not
        prejudice the canon of the Church for when they are discovered they
        shall be deposed.

    <h3>Of the Lapsed</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        Concerning those who have fallen without compulsion, without
        the spoiling of their property, without danger or the like, as happened
        during the tyranny of Licinius, the Synod declares that, though they
        have deserved no clemency, they shall be dealt with mercifully. As
        many as were communicants, if they heartily repent, shall pass three
        years among the hearers; for seven years they shall be prostrators; and
        for two years they shall communicate with the people in prayers, but
        without oblation.
    </p>

    <h3>Of Military Converts</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        As many as were called by grace, and displayed the first zeal, having
        cast aside their military girdles, but afterwards returned, like dogs, to
        their own vomit (so that some spent money and by means of gifts
        regained their military stations); let these, after they have passed the
        space of three years as hearers, be for ten years prostrators. But in all
        these cases it is necessary to examine well into their purpose and what
        their repentance appears to be like. 
        <br /><br />
        
        For as many as give evidence of
        their conversions by deeds, and not pretence, with fear, and tears, and
        perseverance, and good works, when they have fulfilled their
        appointed time as hearers, may properly communicate in prayers; and
        after that the bishop may determine yet more favourably concerning
        them. But those who take the matter with indifference, and who
        think the form of entering the Church is sufficient for their
        conversion, must fulfill the whole time.

    <h3>Of Last Rites</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        Concerning the departing, the ancient canonical law is still to be
        maintained: that, if any man be at the point of death, he must
        not be deprived of the last and most indispensable Viaticum. But, if
        any one should be restored to health again who has received the
        communion when his life was despaired of, let him remain among
        those who communicate in prayers only. But in general, and in the
        case of any dying person whatsoever asking to receive the Eucharist,
        let the Bishop, after examination made, give it him.

    <h3>Of Lapsed Catechumens</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        Concerning catechumens who have lapsed, the holy and great
        Synod has decreed that, after they have passed three years only as
        hearers, they shall pray with the catechumens.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Canon15">Canon 15</h2>
    <h3>Of Wandering Clerics</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        On account of the great disturbance and discords that occur, it is
        decreed that the custom prevailing in certain places contrary to the
        Canon must wholly be done away, so that neither bishop, presbyter,
        nor deacon shall pass from city to city. And if any one, after this
        decree of the holy and great Synod, shall attempt any such thing or
        continue in any such course, his proceedings shall be utterly void.
        He shall be restored to the Church for which he was ordained bishop or
        presbyter.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Canon16">Canon 16</h2>
    <h3>Of Departing Clerics</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        Neither presbyters, nor deacons, nor any others enrolled among the
        clergy, who (not having the fear of God before their eyes nor
        regarding the ecclesiastical Canon) recklessly depart from their
        own church, ought not to be received by another church; but
        every constraint should be applied to restore them to their own
        parishes; and, if they will not go, they must be excommunicated. And
        if anyone shah dare surreptitiously to carry off and
        ordain a man in his own Church belonging to another, without the consent 
        of his own proper bishop, from whom although he was enrolled in the clergy list
        he has seceded, let the ordination be void.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Canon17">Canon 17</h2>
    <h3>Of Usury</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        Forasmuch as many enrolled among the Clergy, following
        covetousness and lust of gain, have forgotten the divine Scripture
        which says, "He hath not given his money upon usury," and in lending
        money ask the hundredth of the sum as monthly interest, the holy and
        great Synod thinks it just that if after this decree any one be found to
        receive usury, whether he accomplish it by secret transaction or
        otherwise, as by demanding the whole and one half, or by using any
        other contrivance whatever for filthy lucre's sake, he shall be deposed
        from the clergy and his name stricken from the list.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Canon18">Canon 18</h2>
    <h3>Of the Ordering of the Eucharist</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        It has come to the knowledge of the holy and great Synod that, in
        some districts and cities, the deacons administer the Eucharist to the
        presbyters, whereas neither canon nor custom permits that they who
        have no right to offer should give the Body of Christ to them that do
        offer. And this also has been made known, that certain deacons now
        touch the Eucharist even before the bishops. 
        <br /><br />
        
        Let all such practices be
        utterly done away, and let the deacons remain within their own
        bounds, knowing that they are the ministers of the bishop and the
        inferiors of the presbyters. Let them receive the Eucharist according to
        their order, after the presbyters, and let either the bishop or the
        presbyter administer to them. Furthermore, let not the deacons sit
        among the presbyters, for that is contrary to canon and order. And if,
        after this decree, any one shall refuse to obey, let him be deposed from
        the diaconate.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2 id="Canon19">Canon 19</h2>
    <h3>Of the Paulianists</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        Concerning the Paulianists who have flown for refuge to the
        Catholic Church, it has been decreed that they must by all means be
        rebaptized; and if any of them who in past time have been numbered
        among their clergy should be found blameless and without reproach,
        let them be rebaptized and ordained by the Bishop of the Catholic
        Church; but if the examination should discover them to be unfit, they
        ought to be deposed. Likewise in the case of their deaconesses, and
        generally in the case of those who have been enrolled among their
        clergy, let the same form be observed. And we mean by deaconesses
        such as have assumed the habit, but who, since they have no
        imposition of hands, are to be numbered only among the laity.

    <h3>Of Kneeling During Prayer</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        Forasmuch as there are certain persons who kneel on the Lord's
        Day and in the days of Pentecost, therefore, to the intent that all things
        may be uniformly observed everywhere, it seems good
        to the holy Synod that prayer be made to God standing.
