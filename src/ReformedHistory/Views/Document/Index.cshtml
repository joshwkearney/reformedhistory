    <h3>Of the Holy Scripture</h3>
    <br />
    <ol>
        <li>
            Although the light of nature, and the works of creation and providence do so far manifest the goodness,
            wisdom, and power of God, as to leave men unexcusable; yet are they not sufficient to give that knowledge 
            of God, and of his will, which is necessary unto salvation.
            <br /><br />
            
            Therefore it pleased the Lord, at sundry times, and in
            divers manners, to reveal himself, and to declare that his will unto his church; and afterwards, for the 
            better preserving and propagating of the truth, and for the more sure establishment and comfort of the 
            church against the corruption of the flesh, and the malice of Satan and of the world, to commit the same 
            wholly unto writing: which maketh the Holy Scripture to be most necessary; those former ways of God's 
            revealing his will unto his people being now ceased.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            Under the name of Holy Scripture, or the Word of God written, are now contained all the books of the Old 
            and New Testaments, which are these:

        <li>
            The books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of divine inspiration, are no part of the canon of the 
            Scripture, and therefore  are of no authority in the church of God, nor to be any otherwise  approved, or 
            made use of, than other human writings.
        </li>

        <li>
            The authority of the Holy Scripture, for which it ought to be believed, and obeyed, dependeth not upon the 
            testimony of any man, or church; but wholly upon God (who is truth itself) the author thereof: and 
            therefore it is to be received, because it is the Word of God.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            We may be moved and induced by the testimony of the church to an high and reverent esteem of the Holy 
            Scripture. And the heavenliness of the matter, the efficacy of the doctrine, the majesty of the style, the 
            consent of all the parts, the scope of the whole (which is, to give all glory to God), the full discovery 
            it makes of the only way of man's salvation, the many other incomparable excellencies, and the entire 
            perfection thereof, are arguments whereby it doth abundantly evidence itself to be the Word of God: yet 
            notwithstanding, our full persuasion and assurance of the infallible truth and divine authority thereof, 
            is from the inward work of the Holy Spirit bearing witness by and with the Word in our hearts.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            The whole counsel of God concerning all things necessary for his own glory, man's salvation, faith and 
            life, is either expressly set down in Scripture, or by good and necessary consequence may be deduced from 
            Scripture: unto which nothing at any time is to be added, whether by new revelations of the Spirit, or 
            traditions of men. Nevertheless, we acknowledge the inward illumination of the Spirit of God to be 
            necessary for the saving understanding of such things as are revealed in the Word: and that there are some 
            circumstances concerning the worship of God, and government of the church, common to human actions and 
            societies, which are to be ordered by the light of nature, and Christian prudence, according to the 
            general rules of the Word, which are always to be observed.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            All things in Scripture are not alike plain in themselves, nor alike clear unto all: yet those things 
            which are necessary to be known, believed, and observed for salvation, are so clearly propounded, and 
            opened in some place of Scripture or other, that not only the learned, but the unlearned, in a due use of 
            the ordinary means, may attain unto a sufficient understanding of them.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            The Old Testament in Hebrew (which was the native language of the people of God of old), and the New 
            Testament in Greek (which, at the time of the writing of it, was most generally known to the nations), 
            being immediately inspired by God, and, by his singular care and providence, kept pure in all ages, are 
            therefore authentical; so as, in all controversies of religion, the church is finally to appeal unto them. 
            But, because these original tongues are not known to all the people of God, who have right unto, and 
            interest in the Scriptures, and are commanded, in the fear of God, to read and search them, therefore they 
            are to be translated into the vulgar language of every nation unto which they come, that, the Word of God 
            dwelling plentifully in all, they may worship him in an acceptable manner; and, through patience and 
            comfort of the Scriptures, may have hope.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            The infallible rule of interpretation of Scripture is the Scripture itself: and therefore, when there is a 
            question about the true and full sense of any Scripture (which is not manifold, but one), it must be 
            searched and known by other places that speak more clearly.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            The supreme judge by which all controversies of religion are to be determined, and all decrees of councils, 
            opinions of ancient writers, doctrines of men, and private spirits, are to be examined, and in whose 
            sentence we are to rest, can be no other but the Holy Spirit speaking in the Scripture.

    <h3>Of God, and of the Holy Trinity</h3>
    <br />
    <ol>
        <li>
            There is but one only, living, and true God, who is infinite in being and perfection, a most pure spirit, 
            invisible, without body, parts, or passions; immutable, immense, eternal, incomprehensible, almighty, most 
            wise, most holy, most free, most absolute; working all things according to the counsel of his own immutable 
            and most righteous will, for his own glory; most loving, gracious, merciful, long-suffering, abundant in 
            goodness and truth, forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin; the rewarder of them that diligently seek 
            him; and withal, most just, and terrible in his judgments, hating all sin, and who will by no means clear 
            the guilty.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            God hath all life, glory, goodness, blessedness, in and of himself; and is alone in and unto himself 
            all-sufficient, not standing in need of any creatures which he hath made, nor deriving any glory from 
            them, but only manifesting his own glory in, by, unto, and upon them. He is the alone fountain of all 
            being, of whom, through whom, and to whom are all things; and hath most sovereign dominion over them, to 
            do by them, for them, or upon them whatsoever himself pleaseth. In his sight all things are open and 
            manifest, his knowledge is infinite, infallible, and independent upon the creature, so as nothing is to 
            him contingent, or uncertain. He is most holy in all his counsels, in all his works, and in all his 
            commands. To him is due from angels and men, and every other creature, whatsoever worship, service, or 
            obedience he is pleased to require of them.
        </li>
        
        <li>In the unity of the Godhead there be three persons, of one  substance, power, and eternity: God the Father, 
            God the Son, and God the  Holy Ghost: the Father is of none, neither begotten, nor proceeding;  the Son is 
            eternally begotten of the Father; the Holy Ghost eternally  proceeding from the Father and the Son.
        </li>
