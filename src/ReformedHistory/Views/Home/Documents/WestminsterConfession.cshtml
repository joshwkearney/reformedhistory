    PREFACE
    The Constitution of the Evangelical Presbyterian Church consists of the Book of Order (comprised
    of The Book of Government, The Book of Discipline, and The Book of Worship), the Westminster
    Confession of Faith (including the Larger and Shorter Catechisms), and the document Essentials of
    our Faith. All these documents are subordinate to the Scripture, which is “the supreme and final
    authority on all matters on which it speaks.”
    You have in your possession the second volume of the Constitution of the Evangelical Presbyterian
    Church. On the recommendation of the Christian Education & Publication Committee, the 28th
    General Assembly (2008) approved publishing the EPC Governing Documents in a more convenient
    and affordable format. What was once the loose leaf “Blue Book” will now be available as:
    The Constitution: Volume 1 – The Book of Order (including Rules for Assembly, Acts of
    Assembly, and Forms for Discipline)
    The Constitution: Volume 2 – The Westminster Confession of Faith and Catechisms (In
    Modern English)
    The Service Forms, which were originally part of the “Blue Book”, will be published separately in
    booklet form, easily used by those presiding at the Sacraments or the ordination and installation of
    officers. A separate publication of Documents of the General Assembly is planned as a reference for
    churches.
    Having the Westminster standards as our doctrinal foundation since our beginning in 1981, the EPC
    adopted the modern English edition of the Confession in 1984. Subsequently the modern English
    Shorter Catechism came into popular use in the EPC, and the 24th General Assembly (2004) approved
    the modern English Larger Catechism.
    According the act of the 5th General Assembly (1985), “Essentials of Our Faith” is published herein
    along with the “Explanatory Statement” added by the 22nd General Assembly (2002).

    Essentials of Our Faith
    All Scripture is self-attesting and being Truth, requires our unreserved submission in all areas of life.
    The infallible Word of God, the sixty-six books of the Old and New Testaments, is a complete and
    unified witness to God’s redemptive acts culminating in the incarnation of the Living Word, the Lord
    Jesus Christ. The Bible, uniquely and fully inspired by the Holy Spirit, is the supreme and final
    authority on all matters on which it speaks.
    On this sure foundation we affirm these additional Essentials of our faith.
    1. We believe in one God, the sovereign Creator and Sustainer of all things, infinitely perfect and
    eternally existing in three persons, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. To Him be all honor, glory and
    praise for ever!
    2. Jesus Christ, the living Word, became flesh through His miraculous conception by the Holy Spirit
    and His virgin birth. He who is true God became true man united in one Person forever. He died
    on the cross a sacrifice for our sins according to the Scriptures. On the third day He arose bodily
    from the dead, ascended into heaven, where, at the right hand of the Majesty on High, He now is
    our High Priest and Mediator.
    3. The Holy Spirit has come to glorify Christ and to apply the saving work of Christ to our hearts.
    He convicts us of sin and draws us to the Savior. Indwelling our hearts, He gives new life to us,
    empowers and imparts gifts to us for service. He instructs and guides us into all truth, and seals us
    for the day of redemption.
    4. Being estranged from God and condemned by our sinfulness, our salvation is wholly dependent
    upon the work of God’s free grace. God credits His righteousness to those who put their faith in
    Christ alone for their salvation, and thereby justifies them in His sight. Only such as are born of
    the Holy Spirit and receive Jesus Christ become children of God and heirs of eternal life.
    5. The true Church is composed of all persons who through saving faith in Jesus Christ and the
    sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit are united together in the body of Christ. The Church finds
    her visible, yet imperfect, expression in local congregations where the Word of God is preached
    in its purity and the sacraments are administered in their integrity, where scriptural discipline is
    practiced, and where loving fellowship is maintained. For her perfecting, she awaits the return of
    her Lord.
    6. Jesus Christ will come again to the earth–personally, visibly, and bodily–to judge the living and
    the dead, and to consummate history and the eternal plan of God. “Even so, come, Lord Jesus.”
    (Rev. 22:20)
    7. The Lord Jesus Christ commands all believers to proclaim the gospel throughout the world and to
    make disciples of all nations. Obedience to the Great Commission requires total commitment to
    “Him who loved us and gave Himself for us.” He calls us to a life of self-denying love and
    service. “For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God
    prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.” (Eph. 2:10)
    These Essentials are set forth in greater detail in the Westminster Confession of Faith.

    Explanatory Statement to
    “Essentials of Our Faith”
    The Westminster Confession of Faith is a confessional statement of orthodox Presbyterianism. The
    Westminster Confession of Faith is our standard of doctrine as found in Scripture. It is a positive
    statement of the Reformed Faith. The Westminster Confession of Faith constitutes a system of
    biblical truth that an officer of the Evangelical Presbyterian Church is required to believe,
    acknowledging that each individual court has the freedom to allow exceptions which do not infringe
    upon the system of doctrine in the Westminster Confession of Faith.
    “Essentials of Our Faith” is an irenic statement of historic evangelicalism. The purpose of “Essentials
    of Our Faith” is to define core beliefs of the Christian Faith. It expresses historic Christian beliefs
    common to all true believers and churches throughout the world. “Essentials of Our Faith” is not
    intended to be the exclusive test of orthodoxy for ordination. It is not intended to be used as an
    explicit standard for minimal core beliefs for candidates, ordination or ministerial examinations. It is
    not to be construed as a substitute for the Westminster Confession of Faith.
    Both the Westminster Confession of Faith and “Essentials of Our Faith” are important documents in
    the Evangelical Presbyterian Church. The Westminster Confession of Faith and “Essentials of Our
    Faith” are not alternative statements of truth, nor are they competitive statements of truth. They each
    serve important and harmonious purposes within the Evangelical Presbyterian Church. The
    Westminster Confession of Faith preserves our commitment to the historic orthodoxy of the
    Reformed Faith. “Essentials of Our Faith” preserves our commitment to historic evangelicalism.

    Proof Texts
    This edition contains a composite of all the proof texts ever cited to support the positions articulated
    in the British and American editions of the Westminster standards. There have been three major
    versions of the proof texts for the Confession of Faith: (a) the 1647 British edition, (b) a revision by
    the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (PCUSA) in 1894, and (c) an equally
    extensive revision by the Presbyterian Church in the United States (PCUS) in 1910. The two revisions
    have hundreds of additions and deletions. None of the deletions are indicated in the notes here, but all
    of the additions are, along with the original proof texts. For the Larger Catechism of 1648, PCUSA
    also did an extensive revision in 1894, which was largely followed by PCUS. The briefer proof texts
    for the Shorter Catechism have basically remained the same. Scriptural references are cited by book,
    chapter, and verse, using abbreviations according to The Chicago Manual of Style.
    In its 1910 revision of the proof texts, PCUS added the following for both the Confession and Larger
    Catechism:
    General Note: At several points the Confession of Faith [or Larger Catechism] is more specific
    in its statements than the Scriptures. These statements are inferences drawn from the Scriptures
    or from statements based on the Scriptures, or from the experience and observation of the
    Church. In such cases, no texts are cited, but reference is made to this General Note.
    The proof texts to the new, American Chapters 34 and 35 were simply grouped by sections.

    Chapter 1
    Holy Scripture
    1. Our natural understanding and the works of creation and providence so clearly show God’s
    goodness, wisdom, and power that human beings have no excuse for not believing in him.1
    However, these means alone cannot provide that knowledge of God and of his will which is
    necessary for salvation.2 Therefore it pleased the Lord at different times and in various ways to
    reveal himself and to declare that this revelation contains his will for his church.3 Afterwards it
    pleased God to put this entire revelation into writing so that the truth might be better preserved
    and transmitted and that the church, confronted with the corruption of the flesh and the evil
    purposes of Satan and the world, might be more securely established and comforted.4 Since
    God no longer reveals himself to his people in those earlier ways,5 Holy Scripture is absolutely
    essential.6
    1. Rom 2.14-15, 1.19-20, Ps 19.1-4, Rom 1.32, 2.1.
    2. 1 Cor 1.21, 2.13-14, 2.9-12, Acts 4.12, Rom 10.13-14.
    3. Heb 1.1-2, Gal 1.11-12, Dt 4.12-14.
    4. Prv 22.19-21, Lk 1.3-4, Rom 15.4, Mt 4.4,7,10, Is 8.19-20, Lk 24.27, 2 Tm 3.16, 2 Pt 3.15-16.
    5. Heb 1.1-2, see General Note.
    6. 2 Tm 3.15-16, 2 Pt 1.10, Lk 16.29-31, Heb 2.1-3.
    2. What we call Holy Scripture or the written word of God now includes all the books of the Old
    and New Testaments which are:
    The Old Testament:
    Genesis 2 Chronicles Daniel
    Exodus Ezra Hosea
    Leviticus Nehemiah Joel
    Numbers Esther Amos
    Deuteronomy Job Obadiah
    Joshua Psalms Jonah
    Judges Proverbs Micah
    Ruth Ecclesiastes Nahum
    1 Samuel Song of Solomon Habakkuk
    2 Samuel Isaiah Zephaniah
    1 Kings Jeremiah Haggai
    2 Kings Lamentations Zechariah
    1 Chronicles Ezekiel Malachi
    The New Testament:
    Matthew Ephesians Hebrews
    Mark Philippians James
    Luke Colossians 1 Peter
    John 1 Thessalonians 2 Peter
    Acts 2 Thessalonians 1 John
    Romans 1 Timothy 2 John
    1 Corinthians 2 Timothy 3 John
    2 Corinthians Titus Jude
    Galatians Philemon Revelation
    Holy Scripture
    4
    All of these books are inspired by God and are the rule of faith and life.7
    7. Lk 16.29,31, Eph 2.20, Rv 22.18-19, 2 Tm 3.16, Mt 11.27.
    3. The books usually called the Apocrypha are not divinely inspired and are not part of the canon
    of Scripture. They therefore have no authority in the church of God and are not to be valued or
    used as anything other than human writings.8
    8. Lk 24.27,44, Rom 3.2, 2 Pt 1.21. The Canon of Scripture is not established by explicit passages, but by the
    testimony of Jesus and his apostles; of ancient manuscripts and versions; of ancient Christian writers and
    church councils, and by the internal evidence exhibited in the separate books.
    4. The Bible speaks authoritatively and so deserves to be believed and obeyed. This authority does
    not depend on the testimony of any man or church but completely on God, its author, who is
    himself truth. The Bible therefore is to be accepted as true, because it is the word of God.9
    9. 2 Pt 1.19,21, 2 Tm 3.16, 1 Jn 5.9, 1 Thes 2.13, Gal 1.11-12.
    5. We may be influenced by the testimony of the church to value the Bible highly and reverently,
    and Scripture itself shows in so many ways that it is God’s word; for example, in its spiritual
    subject matter, in the effectiveness of its teaching, the majesty of its style, the agreement of all
    its parts, its unified aim from beginning to end (to give all glory to God), the full revelation it
    makes of the only way of man’s salvation, its many other incomparably outstanding features,
    and its complete perfection. However, we are completely persuaded and assured of the
    infallible truth and divine authority of the Bible only by the inward working of the Holy Spirit,
    who testifies by and with the word in our hearts.10
    10. 1 Tm 3.15, 1 Jn 2.20,27, Jn 16.13-14, 1 Cor 2.10-12, Isa 59.21, 1 Cor 2.6-9.
    6. The whole purpose of God about everything pertaining to his own glory and to man’s salvation,
    faith, and life is either explicitly stated in the Bible or may be deduced as inevitably and
    logically following from it.11 Nothing is at any time to be added to the Bible, either from new
    revelations of the Spirit or from traditions of men.12 Nevertheless we do recognize that the
    inward illumination of the Spirit of God is necessary for a saving understanding of the things
    which are revealed in the word.13 We also recognize that some provisions for the worship of
    God and the government of the church are similar to secular activities and organizations; these
    are to be directed according to our natural understanding and our Christian discretion and
    should conform to the general rules of the word, which are always to be observed.14
    11. Mk 7.5-7.
    12. 2 Tm 3.15-17, Gal 1.8-9, 2 Thes 2.2. This statement is an inference from the sufficiency of the Scriptures.
    13. Jn 6.45, 1 Cor 2.9-10, 12.
    14. 1 Cor 11.13-14, 14.26,40.
    7. The meanings of all the passages in the Bible are not equally obvious, nor is any individual
    passage equally clear to everyone.15 However, everything which we have to know, believe, and
    observe in order to be saved is so clearly presented and revealed somewhere in the Bible that
    the uneducated as well as the educated can sufficiently understand it by the proper use of the
    ordinary means of grace.16
    15. 2 Pt 3.16, Jn 6.60, 16.17.
    16. Ps 119.105, 130, Acts 17.11-12.
    Holy Scripture
    5
    8. The Old Testament in Hebrew (the native language of the ancient people of God) and the New
    Testament in Greek (the language most widely known internationally at the time the New
    Testament was written) were directly inspired by God17 and have been kept uncontaminated
    throughout time by his special care and providence. They are therefore authentic and are to be
    the church’s ultimate source of appeal in every religious controversy.18 The original languages
    of the Bible, however, are not understood by all of God’s people. But all of God’s people have
    a right to an interest in the Bible and God himself commands them to read it thoroughly with
    awe and reverence for him.19 Consequently the Bible should be translated into the native
    language of every people to whom it is introduced. Then, the word of God will live fully in
    everyone; everyone will be able to worship God in an acceptable way; and all believers may
    have hope through the endurance and the encouragement of the Bible.20
    17. See note under Section 3 above.
    18. Mt 5.18, Is 8.20, Acts 15.14-18, Jn 5.9,46.
    19. Jn 5.39, 2 Tm 3.14-15, 2 Pt 1.19, Acts 17.11.
    20. 1 Cor 14.6, 9, 11-12, 24, 27-28, Col 3.16, Rom 15.4, Mt 28.19-20.
    9. The infallible standard for the interpretation of the Bible is the Bible itself. And so any question
    about the true and complete sense of a passage in the Bible (which is a unified whole) can be
    answered by referring to other passages which speak more plainly.21
    21. 2 Pt 1.20-21, Acts 15.15, Jn 5.46, Mt 4.5-7, 12.1-7.
    10. The Holy Spirit speaking in the Bible is the supreme judge of all religious controversies, all
    decisions of religious councils, all the opinions of ancient writers, all human teachings, and
    every private opinion.22 We are to be satisfied with the judgment of him who is and can be the
    only judge.
    22. Mt 22.29,31, Eph 2.20, Acts 28.25, Lk 10.26, Gal 1.10, 1 Jn 4.1-6.

    Chapter 2
    God and the Holy Trinity
    1. There is only one living and true God,1 who is infinite in being and perfection,2 a completely
    pure spirit,3 invisible,4 without body, parts, or emotions,5 unchangeable,6 immensely vast,7
    eternal,8 limitless,9 almighty,10 completely wise,11 completely holy,12 completely free,13 and
    completely absolute.14 He works everything according to the purpose of his own unchangeable
    and completely righteous will15 for his own glory.16 He is completely loving,17 gracious,
    merciful, and long-suffering. He overflows with goodness and truth. He forgives wickedness,
    transgression, and sin, 18 and rewards those who diligently seek him.19 His judgments are
    completely just and awesome; 20 he hates all sin21 and will not acquit the guilty.22

    2. God has all life, glory, goodness, and blessedness in and of himself.23 He alone is all-sufficient
    in and unto himself, nor does he need any of his creations or derive any glory from them.
    Rather, he manifests his own glory in, by, unto, and on them.24 He is the only source of all
    being, by whom, through whom, and to whom everything exists.25 He has completely sovereign
    dominion over all things and does with, to, or for them whatever he pleases.26 Everything is
    revealed and completely open to him.27 His knowledge is infinite, infallible, and does not
    depend on any created being,28 so that to him nothing is conditional or uncertain.29 He is
    completely holy in all his purposes, works, and commands.30 To him is due whatever worship,
    service, or obedience he is pleased to require from angels, human beings, and all other
    creatures.31

    3. In the unity of the Godhead there are three persons, having one substance, power, and eternity:
    God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit.32 The Father exists. He is not generated
    and does not come from any source. The Son is eternally generated from the Father, 33 and the
    Holy Spirit eternally comes from the Father and the Son.34

    God’s Eternal Decrees
    1. From all eternity and by the completely wise and holy purpose of his own will, God has freely
    and unchangeably ordained whatever happens.1 This ordainment does not mean, however, that
    God is the author of sin (he is not), 2 that he represses the will of his created beings, or that he
    takes away the freedom or contingency of secondary causes. Rather, the will of created beings
    and the freedom and contingency of secondary causes are established by him.3

    2. Although God knows whatever may or can happen under all possible circumstances, 4 he has
    not ordered anything because he foresaw it in the future as something which would happen
    under such circumstances.5

    3. In order to manifest his glory God has ordered that some men and angels should be predestined
    to everlasting life6 and that others should be foreordained to everlasting death.7

    7. Rom 9.22-23, Eph 1.5-6, Prv 16.4, Mt 25.41, Jude 4.
    4. This predestination and foreordination of angels and men are precise and unchangeable. The
    number and identity of angels and men in each group are certain, definite, and unalterable.8
    8. 2 Tm 2.19, Jn 13.18, 10.14-16,27-29, 6.37-39, Acts 13.48, Jn 17.2,6,9-12.
    5. Before the creation of the world, 9 according to his eternal, unchangeable plan10 and the hidden
    purpose and good pleasure of his will, 11 God has chosen in Christ12 those of mankind who are
    predestined to life and to everlasting glory.13 He has done this solely out of his own mercy and
    love and completely to the praise of his wonderful grace.14 This choice was completely
    independent of his foreknowledge of how his created beings would be or act. Neither their faith
    nor good works nor perseverance had any part in influencing his selection.15

    God’s Eternal Decrees
    9
    6. Just as God has determined that the elect shall be glorified, so, too, in the eternal and
    completely free purpose of his will he has foreordained all the means by which that election is
    accomplished.16 And so, those who are chosen, having fallen in Adam, are redeemed by
    Christ.17 They are effectually called to faith in Christ by his Spirit working in them at the right
    time,18 and they are justified,19 adopted,20 sanctified,21 and kept by his power through faith unto
    salvation.22 Only the elect, and no others, are redeemed by Christ, effectually called, justified,
    adopted, sanctified, and saved.23

    7. According to the hidden purpose of his own will, by which he offers or withholds mercy at his
    pleasure, and for the glory of his sovereign power over his creatures, it pleased God not to call
    the rest of mankind24 and to ordain them to dishonor and wrath for their sin25 to the praise of his
    glorious justice.26

    26. 2 Tm 2.19-20, Rv 15.3-4.
    8. This important and mysterious doctrine of predestination must be treated with special discretion
    and care, so that, paying attention to and obeying the will of God revealed in his word, men
    may be assured that they have been eternally chosen from the certainty of their effectual
    calling. In this way the doctrine of predestination will elicit not only our praise, reverence, and
    admiration for God, but also a humble and diligent life, fully supporting everyone who
    sincerely obeys the gospel.27

    Chapter 4
    Creation
    1. In the beginning it pleased God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit 1 to create the world out of
    nothing in order to reveal the glory of his eternal power, wisdom, and goodness.2 He made
    everything in the world, visible and invisible, in the space of six days, and it was very good.3
    1. Heb 1.2, Jn 1.2-3, Gn 1.1-3, Jb 26.13, 33.4, Rom 11.36, 1 Cor 8.6.

    3. Gn 1, Heb 11.3, Col 1.16, Acts 17.24, Ex 20.11.
    2. After God had made all the other creatures, he created man, male and female,4 with reasoning,
    immortal souls.5 He endowed them with knowledge, righteousness, and true holiness in his own
    image6 and wrote his law in their hearts.7 God also gave them the ability to obey his law and the
    potential to disobey it; i.e., he gave them freedom of their own will, which could change.8 In
    addition to this law written in their hearts, they were commanded not to eat from the Tree of the
    Knowledge of Good and Evil.9 As long as they obeyed God’s law and kept this commandment,
    they were happy in fellowship with God10 and had dominion over the other creatures.11

    Chapter 5
    Providence
    1. God, who created everything, also upholds everything. He directs, regulates, and governs every
    creature, action, and thing, from the greatest to the least,1 by his completely wise and holy
    providence.2 He does so in accordance with his infallible foreknowledge3 and the voluntary,
    unchangeable purpose of his own will,4 all to the praise of the glory of his wisdom, power,
    justice, goodness, and mercy.5
    1. Heb 1.3, Dn 4.34-35, Ps 135.6, Acts 17.25-26,28, Jb 38-41, Mt 10.29-31, 6.26,30, Neh 9.6, Ps 114.14-16.

    5. Is 63.14, Eph 3.10, Rom 9.17, Gn 45.7, Ps 145.7.
    2. God is the first cause, and in relationship to him everything happens unchangeably and
    infallibly.6 However, by this same providence, he orders things to happen from secondary
    causes. As a result of these secondary causes, some things must inevitably happen;7 others may
    or may not happen depending on the voluntary intentions of the agents involved; and some
    things do not have to happen but may, depending on other conditions.8
    6. Acts 2.23, see under figures 3 and 4 above, Jer 32.19.
    7. Gn 8.22, Jer 31.35.
    8. Ex 21.13, Dt 19.5, 1 Kgs 22.28,34, Is 10.6-7, Gn 50.19-20.
    3. God uses ordinary means to work out his providence day by day.9 But, as he pleases,10 he may
    work without,11 beyond,12 or contrary to these means.
    9. Acts 27. 24, 31, 44, Is 55.10-11, Hos 2.21-22.

    11. Hos 1.7, Mt 4.4, Jb 34.10.
    12. Rom 4.19-21.
    4. God’s providence reveals his almighty power, unknowable wisdom, and infinite goodness. His
    providence extends even to the fall13 and to all other sins of angels and men.14 These sins are
    not simply allowed by God, but are bound,15 ordered, and governed by him in the fullness of his
    wisdom and power so that they fulfill his own holy purposes.16 However, the sinfulness still
    belongs to the creature and does not proceed from God, whose holy righteousness does not and
    cannot cause or approve sin.17
    13. This statement is sustained by the doctrines of God’s decrees and providence. See citations under Chapter 3
    and Chapter 5, Sections 1, 2, 3.

    Providence
    12
    5. In the fullness of his wisdom, righteousness, and grace God often allows his own children to be
    tempted in various ways and for a time to pursue the corruption of their own hearts. God does
    this to chastise them for their previous sins and to reveal to them the hidden strength of
    corruption and deceitfulness in their hearts, so that they may be humbled.18 In addition to
    various other just and holy results, believers are thereby raised to a closer and more constant
    dependence on God for their support and are also made more alert in detecting and resisting
    opportunities to sin.19
    18. 2 Chr 32.25,26,31, 2 Sm 24.1,25, Dt 8.2, Lk 22.31-32.
    19. 2 Cor 12.7-9, Ps 73, 77.1-12, Mk 14.66-72, Jn 21.15-19.
    6. It is different for the wicked and the ungodly. As punishment for their previous sins, God, the
    righteous judge, spiritually blinds and hardens them in their own sinfulness.20 From them God
    not only withdraws his grace, by which they might have been spiritually enlightened,21 but
    sometimes he also withdraws whatever gift of spiritual understanding they already had22 and
    deliberately exposes them to the opportunities for sinning which their corrupt nature naturally
    seeks.23 He thereby gives them over to their own desires, to the temptations of the world, and to
    the power of Satan,24 and so it happens that they harden themselves even under those
    circumstances which God uses to soften others.25
    20. Rom 1.24-26,28, 11.7-8, 2 Thes 2.11-12.

    7. Just as the providence of God in general extends to every creature, so, in a very special way it
    takes care of his church and orders all things for its good.26
    26. 1 Tm 4.10, Am 9.8-9, Rom 8.28, Is 43.3-5,14, Eph 1.22, Mt 16.18.

    Chapter 6
    The Fall of Man, Sin, and the Punishment for Sin
    1. Our first parents were led astray by the cunning temptation of Satan and sinned in eating the
    forbidden fruit.1 It pleased God to allow them to sin, because in his wisdom and holiness he
    planned to order their sin to his own glory.2
    1. Gn 3.13, 2 Cor 11.3, Gn 3.1-14.
    2. Rom 11.32, 5.19-21.
    2. By this sin they fell from their original righteousness and fellowship with God,3 and so became
    dead in sin4 and completely polluted in all their faculties and parts of body and soul.5
    3. Gn 3.6-8, Eccl 7.29, Rom 3.23, Gn 2.17.
    4. Gn 2.17, Eph 2.1-3, Rom 5.12,
    5. Ti 1.15, Gn 6.5, Jer 17.9, Rom 3.10-19, 8.6-8, Ps 58.1-5.
    3. Since Adam and Eve are the root of all mankind, the guilt for this sin has been imputed to all
    human beings,6 who are their natural descendants and have inherited the same death in sin and
    the same corrupt nature.7
    6. Gn 1.27-28, 2.16-17, Rom 5.12,15-19, Acts 17.26, 1 Cor 15.21-22,45,49.
    7. Ps 51.5, Gn 5.3, Jb 14.4, 15.14, Jn 3 and 6, Rom 3.10-18.
    4. This original corruption completely disinclines, incapacitates, and turns us away from every
    good, while it completely inclines us to every evil.8 From it proceed all actualized sins.9
    8. Rom 5.6, 7.18, 8.7, Col 1.21, Jn 3.6, Gn 6.5, 8.21, Rom 3.10-19.
    9. Jas 1.14-15, Eph 2.2-3, Mt 15.19.
    5. During life on earth this corrupt nature remains in those who are regenerated,10 and, although it
    is pardoned and deadened in Christ, yet it and all its impulses are truly and properly sinful.11
    10. 1 Jn 1.8,10, Rom 7.14, 17-18, 21-23, Jas 3.2, Prv 20.9, Eccl 7.20.
    11. Rom 7.5, 7-8, 25, Gal 5.17.
    6. Every sin, both original and actual, transgresses the righteous law of God and brings guilt on
    the sinner.12 Every sinner is consequently subjected to the wrath of God,13 the curse of the
    law,14 and death,15 with all the resultant miseries, spiritual, temporal, and eternal.16

    Chapter 7
    God’s Covenant with Man
    1. The distance between God and his creation is so great, that, although reasoning creatures owe
    him obedience as their creator, they nonetheless could never realize any blessedness or reward
    from him without his willingly condescending to them. And so it pleased God to provide for
    man by means of covenants.1
    1. Is 40.13-17, Jb 9.32-33, 1 Sm 2.25, Ps 100.2-3, 113.5-6, Jb 22.2-3, 35.7-8, Lk 17.10, Acts 17.24-25, see
    General Note.
    2. The first covenant made with man was a covenant of works.2 In it life was promised to Adam
    and through him to his descendants,3 on the condition of perfect, personal obedience.4
    2. Hos 6.7, Gn 2.16-17, Gal 3.10, Rom 5.12,19, 1 Cor 15.22,47, Gal 3.12.
    3. Rom 5.12-20, 10.5.
    4. Gn 2.17, Gal 3.10; Compare Gn 2.16-17 with Rom 5.12-14, 10.5, Lk 10.25-28, and with the covenants
    made with Noah and Abraham.
    3. By his fall, man made himself incapable of life under that covenant, and so the Lord made a
    second, the covenant of grace.5 In it he freely offers sinners life and salvation through Jesus
    Christ. In order to be saved he requires faith in Jesus6 and promises to give his Holy Spirit to all
    who are ordained to life so that they may be willing and able to believe.7
    5. Gal 3.21, Rom 3.20-21, 8.3, Gn 3.15, Is 42.6, Mt 26.28, Heb 10.5-10.

    4. This covenant of grace is frequently identified in Scripture as a testament, in reference to the
    death of Jesus Christ, the testator, and to the everlasting inheritance and everything included in
    that legacy.8
    8. Heb 9.15-17, 7.22, Lk 22.20, 1 Cor 11.25.
    5. This covenant was administered differently in the time of the law and in the time of the gospel.9
    Under the law it was administered by promises, prophecies, sacrifices, circumcision, the
    paschal lamb, and other types and ordinances given to the Jewish people, all foreshadowing
    Christ.10 For that time the covenant administered under the law through the operation of the
    Spirit was sufficient and effective in instructing the elect and building up their faith in the
    promised Messiah,11 by whom they had full remission of their sins and eternal salvation. This
    administration is called the Old Testament.12

    God’s Covenant with Man
    15
    6. Under the gospel Christ himself, the substance13 of God’s grace, was revealed. The ordinances
    of this New Testament are the preaching of the word and the administration of the sacraments
    of baptism and the Lord’s supper.14 Although these are fewer in number and are administered
    with more simplicity and less outward glory, yet they are available to all nations, Jews and
    Gentiles,15 and in them the spiritual power of the covenant of grace is more fully developed.16
    There are not then two essentially different covenants of grace, but one and the same covenant
    under different dispensations.17

    Chapter 8
    Christ the Mediator
    1. In his eternal purpose it pleased God to choose and ordain the Lord Jesus, his only begotten
    Son, to be the mediator between God and man.1 Jesus is the prophet,2 priest,3 and king,4 the
    head and savior of his church,5 the heir of all things,6 and judge of the world.7 From all eternity
    God gave him a people to be his seed8 and to be in time redeemed, called, justified, sanctified,
    and glorified by him.9
    1. Is 42.1, 1 Pt 1.19-20, Jn 3.16, 1 Tm 2.5.

    2. The Son of God, the second person of the Trinity, is truly the eternal God, of one substance and
    equal with the Father. In the fullness of time he took on himself the nature of man,10 with all the
    essential qualities and ordinary frailties of man—except that he was sinless.11 Jesus was
    conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit in the womb of the Virgin Mary out of her
    substance.12 These two complete, perfect, and distinct natures, the Godhead and the manhood,
    were inseparably joined together in the one person of Jesus without being altered, disunited or
    jumbled.13 The person Jesus is truly God and truly man, yet one Christ, the only mediator
    between God and man.14

    14. Rom 1.3-4, 1 Tm 2.5.
    3. His human nature being thus united to the divine, the Lord Jesus was sanctified and anointed
    with the Holy Spirit beyond all measure.15 He had in him all the treasures of wisdom and
    knowledge,16 and in him it pleased the Father that all fullness should dwell.17 God’s purpose
    was that Jesus, being holy, harmless, undefiled, and full of grace and truth, should be
    completely equipped to execute the office of mediator and guarantor.18 Jesus did not take this
    office himself but was called to it by his Father,19 who gave and commanded him to use all
    power and judgment.20

    4. The Lord Jesus undertook this office completely voluntarily.21 In order to discharge it, he was
    made under22 and perfectly fulfilled the law.23 He endured extremely severe torment in his
    soul24 and extremely painful suffering in his body.25 He was crucified and died.26 He was buried
    and remained under the power of death, but his body did not decay.27 On the third day he arose
    from the dead28 with the same body in which he suffered29 and with which he also ascended into
    heaven. There he sits at the right hand of his Father,30 interceding for believers.31 He will return
    to judge men and angels at the end of the world.32

    5. By his perfect obedience and sacrifice, offered up to God once and for all through the eternal
    Spirit, the Lord Jesus has completely satisfied the justice of his Father33 and purchased not only
    reconciliation but also an everlasting inheritance in the kingdom of heaven for everyone whom
    the Father has given to him.34

    6. Although the work of redemption was not actually done by Christ until after his incarnation, yet
    the power, effectiveness, and benefits of it were given to the elect in all ages from the
    beginning of the world by means of those promises, types, and sacrifices which revealed him
    and indicated that he would be the seed of the woman, would bruise the serpent’s head, and was
    the lamb slain from the beginning of the world. Jesus Christ is yesterday and today and forever
    the same.35
    35. Gal 4.4-5, Gn 3.15, Rv 13.8, Heb 13.8; see citations under Chapter 7, Section 5, figures 9 and 10.
    7. In the work of mediation Christ acts according to both his natures, each nature doing what is
    proper to each.36 However, because of the unity of his person Scripture sometimes attributes
    what is proper to one nature to the person indicated by the other nature.37
    36. Heb 9.14, 1 Pt 3.18, Jn 10.17-18.

    8. Christ insures with absolute certainty that everyone for whom he purchased redemption actually
    accepts and receives it.38 He makes intercession for them,39 reveals the mysteries of salvation to
    them in and by the word,40 and effectively persuades them to believe and obey by his Spirit. He
    governs their hearts by his word and Spirit41 and overcomes all their enemies by his almighty
    power and wisdom in such ways as are most in agreement with his wonderful and unknowable
    administration of things.42

    Chapter 9
    Free Will
    1. God has given man a will, which by nature is free, i.e., it is not forced or necessarily inclined
    toward good or evil.1
    1. Mt 17.12, Jas 1.14, Dt 30.19, Jn 5.40, 7.17, Rv 22.17, Acts 7.51, Jas 4.7.
    2. In his state of innocence man had complete freedom and the natural ability to will and to do
    what is good and pleasing to God.2 God also made man so that he could lose that freedom.3
    2. Eccl 7.29, Gn 1.26, see under figure 1 above, Col 3.10.
    3. Gn 2.16-17, 3.6.
    3. Man fell into a state of sin by his disobedience and so completely lost his ability to will any
    spiritual good involving salvation.4 Consequently fallen man is by nature completely opposed
    to spiritual good,5 is dead in sin,6 and is unable by his own strength either to convert himself or
    to prepare himself for conversion.7
    4. Rom 5.6, 8.7, Jn 15.5.
    5. Rom 3.9-10, 12, 23, 8.7.
    6. Eph 2.1,5, Col 2.13.
    7. Jn 6.44,65, 1 Cor 2.14, Eph 2.2-5, Ti 3.3-5, Rom 8.8.
    4. When God converts a sinner and brings him into a state of grace, he frees him from his natural
    enslavement to sin. By God’s grace alone, freely given, sinful man is enabled to will and to do
    what is spiritually good.8 However, since the old sinful nature also remains, the believer cannot
    consistently or perfectly will to do what is good but also wills evil.9
    8. Col 1.13, Jn 8.34,36, Phil 2.13, Rom 6.18,22.
    9. Gal 5.17, Rom 7.15,18-19,21-23, 1 Jn 1.8,10.
    5. The will of man is perfectly free and permanently inclined to good alone only in the state of
    glory.10
    10. Eph 4.13, Heb 12.23, 1 Jn 3.2, Jude 24, Rv 22.3-4, 2 Chr 6.36, 1 Jn 1.8-10, 2.1-6, Ps 17.15.

    Chapter 10
    Effectual Calling
    1. At the right time, appointed by him, God effectually calls all those and only those whom he has
    predestined to life. He calls them by his word and Spirit out of their natural state of sin and
    death into grace and salvation through Jesus Christ.1 He enlightens their minds spiritually with
    a saving understanding of the things of God.2 He takes away their heart of stone and gives them
    a heart of flesh.3 He renews their wills and by his almighty power leads them to what is good.4
    And so he effectually draws them to Jesus Christ.5 But they come to Jesus voluntarily, having
    been made willing by God’s grace.6
    1. Rom 8.28,30, 11.7, Eph 1.5,10-11, 2 Thes 2.13-14, 2 Cor 3.3,6, Rom 8.2, 2 Tm 1.9-10, Jn 15.16, Acts
    13.48, 1 Thes 5.9, Jas 1.18, 1 Cor 2.12, Eph 2.1-10.
    2. Acts 26.18, 1 Cor 2.10,12, Eph 1.17-18, 2 Cor 4.6.
    3. Ez 36.26.
    4. Ez 11.19, Phil 2.13, Dt 30.6, Ez 36.27, Phil 4.13, Jn 3.5, Gal 6.15, Ti 3.5, 1 Pt 1.23.
    5. Eph 1.19, Jn 6.44-45.
    6. Sg 1.4, Ps 110.3, Jn 6.37, Rom 6.16-18, Mt 11.28, Rv 22.17; see under figure 5 above.
    2. This effectual call is freely made by God and is entirely an act of his special grace. It does not
    depend on anything God foreknew or foresaw about the person called, 7 who is completely
    passive. God himself gives life and renewal by the Holy Spirit.8 He thereby enables each person
    to answer his call and to accept the grace he offers and actually gives.9
    7. 2 Tm 1.9, Ti 3.4-5, Eph 2.4-5, 8-9, Rom 9.11.
    8. 1 Cor 2.14, Rom 8.7-9, Eph 2.5.
    9. Jn 6.37, Ez 36.27, Jn 5.25.
    3. Elect infants, dying in infancy, are regenerated and saved by Christ, through the Spirit,10 who
    works when, where, and how he pleases.11 The same is true of all other elect persons who are
    incapable of being outwardly called by the ministry of the word.12
    10. Lk 18.15-16, Acts 2.38-39, Jn 3.3,5-6, 1 Jn 5.12, Rom 8.9, Gn 17.7, Ps 105.8-10, Ez 16.20-21, Gal 3.29,
    Acts 16.15,31-33, 1 Cor 1.16.
    11. Jn 3.8.
    12. 1 Jn 5.12, Acts 4.12, Jn 3.8, 16.7-8.
    4. Others, not elect, may be called by the ministry of the word, and the Spirit may work in them in
    some of the same ways he works in the elect. However, they never truly come to Christ and
    therefore cannot be saved.13 And, of course, people, not professing the Christian religion,
    cannot be saved in any other way at all,14 no matter how hard they try to live a moral life
    according to their own understanding or try to follow the rules of some other religion. To say
    they can be saved is extremely harmful and should be denounced.15
    13. Mt 22.14, 7.22, 13-15, 20-21, Heb 6.4-6, Jn 6.64-66, 8.24, 1 Jn 2.19, Acts 28.24.

    Chapter 11
    Justification
    1. Those whom God effectually calls he also freely justifies.1 He does not pour righteousness into
    them but pardons their sins and looks on them and accepts them as if they were righteous—not
    because of anything worked in them or done by them, but for Christ’s sake alone. He does not
    consider their faith itself, the act of believing, as their righteousness or any other obedient
    response to the gospel on their part. Rather, he imputes to them the obedience and judicial
    satisfaction earned by Christ.2 For their part, they receive and rest on Christ and his
    righteousness by faith (and this faith is not their own but is itself a gift of God).3
    1. Rom 8.30, 3.24.
    2. Rom 4.5-8, 2 Cor 5.19,21, Rom 3.22,24-25,27-28, Ti 3.5,7, Eph 1.7, Jer 23.6, 1 Cor 1.30-31, Rom 5.17-19.
    3. Acts 10.43-44, Gal 2.16, Phil 3.9, Acts 13.38-39, Eph 2.7-8, Jn 1.12, 6.44-45, Phil 1.29.
    2. Faith, thus receiving and resting on Christ and his righteousness, is the only means of
    justification.4 In the person justified, however, it is always accompanied by all the other saving
    graces and is not a dead faith, but works by love.5
    4. Jn 1.12, Rom 3.28, 5.1, Jn 3.16,18,36.
    5. Jas 2.17,22,26, Gal 5.6.
    3. By his obedience and death Christ completely discharged the debt of all those who are so
    justified, and he made the correct, real, and full satisfaction to his Father’s justice on their
    behalf.6 Since Christ was voluntarily given by the Father for them,7 and since his obedience and
    satisfaction were accepted in their place8 and not for anything in them, their justification is the
    result only of his free grace9—so that both the perfect justice and the rich grace of God might
    be glorified in the justification of sinners.10
    6. Rom 5.8-10,18-19, 1 Tm 2.5-6, Heb 10.10,14, Dn 9.24,26, Is 53.4-6,10-12, 1 Cor 15.3, 2 Cor 5.21, 1 Pt
    2.24, 3.18.

    9. Rom 3.24, Eph 1.7, Rom 6.23, Eph 2.6-9.
    10. Rom 3.26, Eph 2.7.
    4. From all eternity God decreed the justification of all the elect,11 and in the fullness of time
    Christ died for their sins and rose again for their justification.12 Nevertheless, the elect are not
    justified until the Holy Spirit in due time does actually apply Christ to them.13
    11. Gal 3.8, 1 Pt 1.2,19-20, Rom 8.30.
    12. Gal 4.4, 1 Tm 2.6, Rom 4.25, 1 Pt 1.21.
    13. Col 1.21-22, Gal 2.16, Ti 3.4-7, Jn 3.5,18,36.
    5. God continues to forgive the sins of those who are justified.14 Although they can never fall from
    the state of justification,15 they may by their sins come under God’s fatherly displeasure and not
    have a sense of his presence with them until they humble themselves, confess their sins, ask for
    forgiveness, and renew their faith in repentance.16
    14. Mt 6.12, 1 Jn 1.7,9, 2.1-2.
    15. Lk 22.32, Jn 10.28, Heb 10.14, Phil 1.6, 1 Jn 2.19; see proofs under Chapter 17.

    Justification
    22
    6. The justification of believers under the Old Testament was in all these respects identical with
    the justification of believers under the New Testament.17
    17. Gal 3.6-9,13-14, Rom 4.22-24, Heb 13.8, 11.13, Jn 8.56, Acts 15.11, Rom 3.30.
    23
    Chapter 12
    Adoption
    1. God guarantees the adoption of all those who are justified in and for the sake of his only son,
    Jesus Christ.1 Those adopted enjoy the liberties and privileges of God’s children,2 have his
    name put on them,3 receive the Spirit of adoption,4 have access to the throne of grace with
    boldness,5 and are enabled to cry, Abba, Father.6 They are pitied,7 protected,8 provided for,9 and
    disciplined by him as a father.10 They are never cast off, however,11 and are sealed until the day
    of redemption12 and inherit the promises13 as heirs of everlasting salvation.14

    Chapter 13
    Sanctification
    1. Those who are effectually called and regenerated have a new heart and a new spirit created in
    them. They are additionally sanctified, actually and personally, by the power of Christ’s death
    and resurrection and by his word and Spirit dwelling in them.1 The power of sin ruling over the
    whole body is destroyed,2 and the desires of the old self are more and more weakened and
    killed.3At the same time the ability to practice true holiness, without which no one will see the
    Lord,4 is brought to life and strengthened by all the saving graces.5
    1. 1 Cor 6.11, Acts 20.32, Phil 3.10, Rom 6.5-6, Jn 17.17,19, Eph 5.26, 2 Thes 2.13, 1 Cor 1.30.
    2. Rom 6.6,14.
    3. Gal 5.24, Rom 8.13, Col 3.5.
    4. 2 Cor 7.1, Heb 12.14, Col 1.28, 4.12.
    5. Col 1.10-11, Eph 3.16-19, 2 Pt 3.13-14.
    2. This sanctification works in the whole person,6 but not completely or perfectly in this life. The
    old sinful nature retains some of its control in body, mind, and spirit. And so a continual and
    irreconcilable war goes on in every believer. The old nature tries to get its way in opposition to
    the Spirit, and the Spirit fights to assert its authority over the flesh.7
    6. 1 Thes 5.23.
    7. 1 Jn 1.10, Rom 7.18,23, Phil 3.12, Gal 5.17, 1 Pt 2.11.
    3. Although the old nature temporarily wins battles in this warfare,8 the continual strengthening of
    the sanctifying Spirit of Christ enables the regenerate nature in each believer to overcome.9 And
    so the saints grow in grace,10 perfecting holiness in the fear of God.11
    8. Rom 7.23.
    9. Rom 6.14, 1 Jn 5.4, Eph 4.15-16.

    25
    Chapter 14
    Saving Faith
    1. The gift of faith makes it possible for the souls of the elect to be saved by believing in Jesus
    Christ. This gift is the work of the Spirit of Christ in the hearts of the elect1 and is ordinarily
    accomplished by the ministry of the word.2 It is also increased and strengthened by the word,
    by prayer, and by the administration of the sacraments.3
    1. Heb 10.39, 2 Cor 4.13, Eph 1.17-20, 2.8, 1 Cor 12.3, Heb 12.2; see proofs under Chapter 11.
    2. Rom 10.14,17, Mt 28.19-20, 1 Cor 1.21.
    3. 1 Pt 2.2, Acts 20.32, Rom 4.11, Lk 17.5, Rom 1.16-17, Mt 28.19, 1 Cor 11.23-29, 2 Cor 12.8-10, Lk 22.19,
    Jn 6.54-56, Lk 22.32.
    2. By this faith a Christian believes whatever is revealed in the word to be the true, authentic,
    authoritative statement of God himself.4 By this faith the believer also acts according to what
    particular passages in the word say. By faith the believer humbly submits to and obeys God’s
    various commands.5 He trembles at God’s awesome threats,6 and eagerly embraces his
    promises about this life and the life to come.7 But the chief actions of saving faith are
    accepting, receiving, and resting on Christ alone for justification, sanctification, and eternal life,
    in the power of the covenant of grace.8
    4. Jn 4.42, 1 Thes 2.13, 1 Jn 5.10, Acts 24.14.
    5. Rom 16.26, Mt 22.37-40.
    6. Is 66.2.
    7. Heb 11.13, 1 Tm 4.8.
    8. Jn 1.12, Acts 16.31, Gal 2.20, Acts 15.11.
    3. This faith has different degrees of strength and weakness.9 It may be attacked and weakened
    often and in many ways, but it gets the victory.10 In many believers it matures and becomes
    completely assured through Christ,11 who both creates and perfects our faith.12
    9. Heb 5.13-14, Rom 4.19-20, Mt 6.30, 8.10.
    10. Lk 22.31-32, Eph 6.16, 1 Jn 5.4-5, 1 Cor 10.13.

    Chapter 15
    Repentance Leading to Life
    1. Repentance which leads to life is the blessed product of the gospel working in believers’
    lives.1Along with the doctrine of faith in Christ, it is a doctrine to be preached by every minister
    of the gospel.2
    1. Zec 12.10, Acts 11.18.
    2. Lk 24.47, Mk 1.15, Acts 20.21.
    2. In this repentance the sinner is able to see his sins as God sees them, as filthy and hateful, and
    as involving great danger to the sinner, because they are completely contrary to the holy nature
    and righteous law of God. Understanding that God in Christ is merciful to those who repent, the
    sinner suffers deep sorrow for and hates his sins, and so he determines to turn away from all of
    them. And turning to God,3 he tries to walk with him according to all his commandments.4
    3. Ez 18.30-31, 36.31, Is 30.22, Ps 51.4, Jer 31.18-19, Jl 2.12-13, Am 5.15, Ps 119.128, 2 Cor 7.11.
    4. Ps 119.6,59,106, Lk 1.6, 2 Kgs 23.25, Jn 14.23,
    Mt 21.28-29.
    3. Although repentance is not any satisfaction for sin and does not cause the forgiveness of sins5
    (since forgiveness is an act of God’s voluntary grace in Christ6), yet it is necessary to all
    sinners, and no one may expect to be forgiven without it.7
    5. Ez 36.31-32, 16.61-63, Ti 3.5, Acts 5.31.
    6. Hos 14.2,4, Rom 3.24, Eph 1.7.
    7. Lk 13.3,5, Acts 17.30-31.
    4. Just as there is no sin so small that it does not deserve damnation,8 so there is no sin so great
    that it can bring damnation upon those who truly repent.9
    8. Rom 6.23, 5.12, Mt 12.36, Jas 2.10.
    9. Is 55.7, Rom 8.1, Is 1.16,18.
    5. Believers should not be satisfied with general repentance. Rather, it is everyone’s duty to try to
    repent of every individual sin individually.10
    10. Ps 19.13, Lk 19.8, 1 Tm 1.13,15, Dn 9, Neh 9.
    6. Everyone is also bound to confess privately his sins to God and to pray for forgiveness for
    them.11 Confession, prayer for forgiveness, and the forsaking of sins which have been forgiven
    will find God’s mercy.12 Similarly, anyone who sins against his spiritual brother or the church
    should be willing to confess, privately or publicly, to demonstrate sorrow for his sin, and
    openly to state his repentance to those whom he has hurt.13 They in turn are to be reconciled to
    him and to receive him in love.14

    Chapter 16
    Good Works
    1. Good works are only those works identified as good by God and commanded by him in his
    holy word.1 They do not include other works, no matter how well-intentioned in design or
    zealously promoted by men.2
    1. Mi 6.8, Rom 12.2, Heb 13.21, Dt 12.32, Ps 119.9, Mt 28.20, Lk 10.25-26, 2 Pt 1.19.
    2. Mt 15.9, Is 29.13, 1 Pt 1.18, Rom 10.2, Jn 16.2, 1 Sm 15.21-23, Col 2.16-17,20-23, Dt 10.12-13.
    2. These good works, done in obedience to God’s commandments, are the fruit and evidence of a
    true and living faith.3 By them believers show their thankfulness,4 strengthen their assurance of
    salvation,5 edify their brothers in the Lord,6 and become ornaments of all those who profess the
    gospel.7 Good works in believers silence the criticism of the enemies of the gospel.8 They also
    glorify God9 by showing that believers are the workmanship and creation of Jesus Christ,10
    because their aim is that holiness of living which leads to eternal life.11
    3. Jas 2.18,22.
    4. Ps 116.12-13, 1 Pt 2.9, Col 3.17, 1 Chr 29.6-9.
    5. 1 Jn 2.3,5, 2 Pt 1.5-10.
    6. 2 Cor 9.2, Mt 5.16, 1 Tm 4.12.

    9. 1 Pt 2.12, Phil 1.11, Jn 15.8.
    10. Eph 2.10.
    11. Rom 6.22.
    3. Believers get the ability to do good works entirely from the Spirit of Christ.12 In addition to the
    other particular effects of God’s grace already received, believers must be directed by the Holy
    Spirit in order to will and to do what pleases God.13 However, they are not therefore to grow
    spiritually lazy, waiting for some special guidance from the Spirit before doing anything
    commanded by God. Rather, they should diligently attempt to identify what good works God
    has commanded in his word and then try their best to do all of them, praying earnestly and daily
    for the empowering and enabling of the Holy Spirit, who lives in them.14
    12. Jn 15.4-6, Ez 36.26-27, Lk 11.13.
    13. Phil 2.13, 4.13, 2 Cor 3.5, Eph 3.16.
    14. Phil 2.12, Heb 6.11-12, 2 Pt 1.3,5,10-11, Is 64.7, 2 Tm 1.6, Acts 26.6-7, Jude 20-21.
    4. Those believers who do the best that can be done in obeying God in this life can never do more
    or even as much as he requires. Indeed they fall short of much which they are bound to do.15
    15. Lk 17.10, Neh 13.22, Jb 9.2-3, Gal 5.17.
    Good Works
    28
    5. We cannot, of course, by our best works deserve to be forgiven for our sins and to receive
    eternal life from God. There is that great disproportion between our best works in this life and
    the glory which is going to be revealed in us, and there is the infinite distance between us and
    God, who does not profit from our best works and is not satisfied by them for the debt of our
    previous sins.16 When we have done all we can, we have only done our duty and are
    unprofitable servants.17 Since the goodness of our best works in fact proceeds from his Spirit18
    and since, insofar as they are done by us, our best works are defiled and mixed with our
    weakness and imperfection, they cannot therefore even stand the scrutiny of God’s judgment.19
    16. Rom 3.20, 4.2,4,6, Eph 2.8-9, Ti 3.5-7, Rom 8.18,22-24, Ps 16.2, Jb 22.2-3, 35.7-8.

    19. Is 64.6, Gal 5.17, Rom 7.15,18, Ps 143.2, 130.3.
    6. Nevertheless, since the persons of believers are accepted through Christ, their good works in
    this life are also accepted in him.20 It is not as though they were perfect in God’s sight21 but that
    God, looking on them in his Son, is pleased to accept and reward what is sincerely done, even
    though accompanied by much weakness and imperfection.22
    20. Eph 1.6, 1 Pt 2.5, Ex 28.38, Gn 4.4, Heb 11.4.

    22. Heb 13.20-21, 2 Cor 8.12, Heb 6.10, Mt 25.21,23.
    7. Works done by people who have not been spiritually reborn may be the same as those
    commanded by God and may be of good use to them and to others.23 However, since they do
    not proceed from a heart purified by faith, 24 are not done in the right way, i.e., in response to
    God’s word,25 and are not done for the right purpose, the glory of God,26 they are therefore
    sinful and cannot please God or make a person fit to receive grace from God.27 Nevertheless, it
    is more sinful and displeasing to God not to do such works than to do them.28

    Chapter 17
    The Perseverance of the Saints
    1. Those whom God has accepted in his Son and has effectually called and sanctified by his Spirit
    can never completely or finally fall out of their state of grace. Rather, they shall definitely
    continue in that state to the end and are eternally saved.1
    1. Phil 1.6, 2 Pt 1.10, Jn 10.28-29, 1 Jn 3.9, 1 Pt 1.5,9, Jb 17.9, Jer 32.40.
    2. This endurance of the saints does not depend on their own free will but on God’s unchangeable
    decree of election, flowing from his voluntary, unchangeable love.2 It also depends on the
    effectiveness of the merit and intercession of Jesus Christ,3 on the indwelling Spirit and
    indwelling seed of God in the saints,4 and on the nature of the covenant of grace.5 All these
    establish the certainty and infallibility of their preservation.6
    2. 2 Tm 2.18-19, Jer 31.3, Eph 1.4-5, Jn 13.1, Rom 8.35-39.
    3. Heb 10.10,14, 13.20-21, 9.12-15, Rom 8.32-39, Jn 17.11,24, Lk 22.32, Heb 7.25.

    6. Jn 10.28, 2 Thes 3.3, 1 Jn 2.19, 1 Thes 5.23-24, Heb 6.17-20.
    3. Nevertheless, the temptations of Satan, the world, and their old carnal nature, along with
    neglect of the means of their preservation, may lead believers to commit serious sins and to
    continue in them for a time.7 They consequently displease God8 and grieve his Holy Spirit,9
    have some of the fruit of God’s grace and his comforts taken away from them,10 have their
    hearts hardened11 and their consciences wounded,12 hurt and offend others,13 and bring temporal
    judgments on themselves.14

    Chapter 18
    The Assurance of Grace and Salvation
    1. Hypocrites and other unregenerate men may deceive themselves with false hopes and carnal
    presumptions about their being in God’s favor and about their being saved.1 Their presumptions
    will die with them.2 However, those who truly believe in the Lord Jesus, who honestly love him
    and try to walk in good conscience before him, may in this life be assured with certainty that
    they are in a state of grace.3 They may also rejoice in the hope of the glory of God, and they
    will never be ashamed of that hope.4
    1. Jb 8.13-14, Mi 3.11, Dt 29.19, Jn 8.41.
    2. Mt 7.22-23, Jb 8.13.
    3. 1 Jn 2.3, 3.14, 18-19,21,24, 5.13, 2 Tm 1.12.
    4. Rom 5.2, 5; see citations under 3 above; 2 Tm 4.7-8.
    2. This certainty is not based on the fallible hope of guesswork or probabilities. Rather, it is the
    infallible assurance of faith,5 established on the divine truth of the promises of salvation.6 There
    is also the inner evidence of spiritual insight, given to us by God, to which these promises are
    directed.7 And there is the testimony of the Spirit of adoption, witnessing with our spirits that
    we are the children of God.8 This Spirit is the pledge of our inheritance. By him we are sealed
    until the day of redemption.9
    5. Heb 6.11-12,19; see citations under 3 and 4 above.
    6. Heb 6.17-18, 2 Pt 1.4-5.
    7. 2 Pt 1.4-5,10-11, 1 Jn 2.3, 3.14, 2 Cor 1.12.
    8. Rom 8.15-16.
    9. Eph 1.13-14, 4.30, 2 Cor 1.21-22.
    3. This infallible assurance is not so essential to faith that a true believer may not have doubts and
    conflicts about it, possibly wait some time for it, and grow into it.10 But since the Spirit enables
    believers to know the things which are freely given to them by God, every believer may come
    to a full assurance of salvation by the ordinary working of the Spirit without unusual
    revelation.11 Therefore it is every believer’s duty to establish the certainty of his calling and
    election12 so that his heart may be filled with peace and joy in the Holy Spirit, with love and
    thankfulness to God, and with strength and cheerfulness of obedience. These are the true
    products of assurance,13 which is never conducive to an undisciplined life.14

    The Assurance of Grace and Salvation
    31
    4. The assurance true believers have of their salvation may be shaken, lessened, or interrupted for
    various reasons: from neglecting to preserve it; from committing some particular sin, which
    wounds the conscience and grieves the Spirit; from some sudden or strong temptation; or from
    God’s withdrawing the sense of his presence and allowing them to walk in darkness.15
    Nevertheless, they are never completely without God’s seed, the life of faith, the love of Christ
    and of other believers, and the sincere heart and obedient conscience, out of which the Spirit
    may revive this assurance in due time16 and by which they are in the meantime kept from
    complete despair.17

    Chapter 19
    The Law of God
    1. God gave Adam a law as a covenant of works. He required Adam and all his descendants to
    obey this law, individually, completely, perpetually, and in precise accordance with its
    provisions. God promised life for keeping it and threatened death for disobeying it, and he gave
    man the power and ability to keep it.1
    1. Gn 1.26-27, 2.17, Rom 2.14-15, 10.5, 5.12,19, Gal 3.10,12, Eccl 7.29, Jb 28.28, Eph 4.24.
    2. After the fall this law continued to be a perfect rule of righteousness and was given, as such, by
    God on Mount Sinai in the Ten Commandments, written on two tablets.2 The first four
    commandments establish our obligations to God and the remaining six our obligations to
    human beings.3
    2. Jas 1.25, 2.8,10-12, Rom 13.8-9, Dt 5.32, 10.4, Ex 34.1, Rom 3.19, Gal 3.12, Hos 6.7, Gn 2.16-17; compare
    Rom 5.12-14, 1 Cor 15.22, Lk 10.25-28, and the covenants made with Noah and Abraham; Gn 1.26, Dt
    30.19, Jn 7.17, Rv 22.17, Jas 1.14.
    3. Mt 22.37-40, Ex 20.3-18.
    3. In addition to this law, ordinarily called the moral law, it pleased God to give the people of
    Israel, as a pre-Christian assembly of believers, ceremonial laws, containing many typical
    ordinances. Some of these ordinances pertain to worship and foreshadow Christ, his grace,
    actions, suffering, and the benefits to be had from believing in him.4 The rest of these
    ordinances contain various instructions about moral duties.5 All of these ceremonial laws are
    now nullified under the New Testament.6
    4. Heb 9, 10.1, Gal 4.1-3, Col 2.17.
    5. 1 Cor 5.7, 2 Cor 6.17, Jude 23; see Lv 5.1-6, 6.1-7, and similar passages, Ex 12.14.
    6. Col 2.14,16-17, Dn 9.27, Eph 2.15-16, Mk 7.18-19, Gal 2.4.
    4. God also gave the Israelites, as a political body, various judicial laws. These expired with the
    state of Israel and make no further obligation on God’s people than seems appropriate in
    contemporary legal codes.7
    7. Ex 21, 22.1-29, Gn 49.10, 1 Pt 2.13-14, Mt 5.17,38-39, 1 Cor 9.8-10.
    5. The moral law, however, does pertain to everyone, saved and unsaved, forever, not just with
    respect to its content but also in relationship to the authority of God, the Creator, who gave it.8
    In the gospel Christ does not in any way remove this obligation, but rather strengthens it.9
    8. Rom 13.8-10, Eph 6.2, 1 Jn 2.3-4,7-8, Rom 3.31, 6.15, Jas 2.8,10-11; see citations under Section 2 above,
    Rom 3.19.
    9. Mt 5.17-19, Jas 2.8, Rom 3.31.
    The Law of God
    33
    6. Although true believers are not justified or condemned by the law as a covenant of works,10 the
    law is nevertheless very useful to them and to others. As a rule of life, it informs them of God’s
    will and of their obligation to obey it.11 It also reveals to them the sinful pollution of their
    nature, hearts, and lives,12 so that, examining themselves from its point of view, they may
    become more convinced of the presence of sin in them, more humiliated on account of that sin,
    and hate sin the more.13 Thus they gain a better awareness of their need for Christ and for the
    perfection of his obedience.14 The prohibitions against sin15 in the law are also useful in
    restraining believers from pursuing the desires of their old nature, and the punishments for
    disobedience in the law show them what their sins deserve and what afflictions they may expect
    for them in this life, even though they have been freed from the curse threatened in the law.16
    The promises of the law similarly show them that God approves obedience and that blessings
    may be expected for obedience,17 although not as their due from the law as a covenant of
    works.18 The fact that the law encourages doing good and discourages doing evil does not mean
    that a person who does good and refrains from evil is under the law and not under grace.19
    10. Rom 6.14, Gal 2.16, 3.13, 4.4-5, Acts 13.39, Rom 8.1.
    11. Rom 7.12,22,25, Ps 119.4-6, 1 Cor 7.19, Gal 5.14,16,18-23.
    12. Rom 7.7, 3.20.

    19. Rom 6.12,14, 1 Pt 3.8-12, Ps 34.12-16, Heb 12.28-29.
    7. None of these uses of the law is contrary to the grace of the gospel. They rather beautifully
    comply with it,20 because the Spirit of Christ subdues and enables the will of man to do
    voluntarily and cheerfully what the will of God, revealed in the law, requires to be done.21

    Chapter 20
    Christian Freedom and Freedom of Conscience
    1. Christ has purchased for believers under the gospel freedom from the guilt of sin, from the
    condemning wrath of God, and from the curse of the moral law.1 He has also freed them from
    the evil world we live in, from enslavement to Satan, from the dominion of sin,2 the evil of
    afflictions, the sting of death, the victory of the grave, and from everlasting damnation.3 In
    Christ believers have free access to God4 and can obey him, not out of slavish fear, but with a
    childlike love and a willing mind.5All these freedoms were also held by believers under the
    law.6 However, under the New Testament, the liberty of Christians has been enlarged to include
    freedom from the yoke of the ceremonial law, to which the Jewish church was subjected.7
    Christians also have greater boldness of access to the throne of grace8 and a fuller gift of the
    Spirit of God than believers ordinarily had under the law.9

    9. Jn 7.38-39, 2 Cor 3.13, 17-18, Rom 5.5.
    2. God alone is Lord of the conscience and has left it free from the doctrines and commandments
    of men which are in any way contrary to or different from his word in matters of faith or
    worship.10 And so, believing any such teachings or obeying any such commandments of men
    for conscience’s sake actually betrays true freedom of conscience.11 Requiring implicit or
    absolute, blind obedience also destroys freedom of conscience as well as the free use of
    reason.12
    10. Jas 4.12, Rom 14.4,10, Acts 4.19, 5.29, 1 Cor 7.23, Mt 23.8-10, 2 Cor 1.24, Mt 15.9.

    3. Those who practice any sin or nourish any sinful desire on the pretext of Christian freedom
    destroy the whole purpose of Christian freedom, which is, that, having been rescued out of the
    hands of our enemies, we might serve the Lord without fear and in holiness and righteousness
    before him all the days of our lives.13
    13. Gal 5.13, 1 Pt 2.16, 2 Pt 2.19, Jn 8.34, Lk 1.74-75, Rom 6.15,2 Pt 3.15.
    Christian Freedom and Freedom of Conscience
    35
    4. God intends that the authorities he has ordained on earth and the freedom Christ has purchased
    should not destroy but mutually uphold and preserve each other. And so, those who oppose
    any lawful power or the lawful exercise of power, whether civil or ecclesiastical, on the pretext
    of Christian freedom, are actually resisting God.14 The support, promotion, or practice of such
    opposition, which contradicts natural understanding or the known principles of Christianity on
    matters of faith, worship, and associations, which denies the power of godliness, or which
    disrupts the peace and unity among believers, should lawfully be called to account and
    proceeded against by the church.15

    Chapter 21
    Religious Worship and the Sabbath Day
    1. Natural understanding reveals that there is a God, who is lord and sovereign over everything,
    who is good and does good to everyone, and who is therefore to be held in awe, loved, praised,
    called upon, trusted in, and served with all our heart, soul, and might.1 The acceptable way of
    worshiping the true God is established by God himself. God’s revealed will so defines and
    outlines proper worship that neither the imaginations and devices of men nor the suggestions of
    Satan are to be followed. God is not to be worshiped under any visible representation or in any
    other way than that prescribed in Holy Scripture.2
    1. Rom 1.19-20, Acts 17.24, Ps 119.68, Jer 10.7, Ps 31.23, 18.3, Rom 10.12, Ps 62.8, Jos 24.14, Mk 12.33, Ps
    19.1-6, Acts 14.17.
    2. Dt 12.32, Mt 15.9, Acts 17.24-25, Mt 4.9-10, Dt 4.15-20, Ex 20.4-6, Col 2.20-23, Jn 4.23-24.
    2. Religious worship is to be given to God, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and only to him,3 not
    to angels, saints, or any other creature.4 Since the fall this worship must involve a mediator, and
    there is no other mediator than Christ alone.5
    3. Mt 4.10, Jn 5.23, 2 Cor 13.14, Rv 5.11-14, Mt 28.19.
    4. Col 2.18, Rv 19.10, Rom 1.25.
    5. Jn 14.6, 1 Tm 2.5, Eph 2.18, Col 3.17.
    3. Prayer with thanksgiving is one part of religious worship6 and is required by God from all men.7
    In order for prayer to be accepted, it must be made in the name of Jesus,8 by the help of his
    Spirit,9 according to his will,10 with understanding, reverence, humility, fervor, faith, love, and
    perseverance,11 and, if vocal, in a known tongue.12
    6. Phil 4.6, 1 Tm 2.1, Col 4.2.
    7. Ps 65.2, Lk 18.1, 1 Tm 2.8, Ps 67.3, 1 Thes 5.17-18.
    8. Jn 14.13-14, 1 Pt 2.5.
    9. Rom 8.26, Eph 6.18.
    10. 1 Jn 5.14.
    11. Ps 47.7, Eccl 5.1-2, Heb 12.28, Gn 18.27, Jas 5.16, 1.6-7, Mk 11.24, Mt 6.12,14-15, Col 4.2, Eph 6.18.
    12. 1 Cor 14.14.
    4. Prayer is to be made for lawful things13 and for people who are alive or may be born,14 but not
    for the dead,15 nor for those who are known to have committed the sin unto death.16
    13. 1 Jn 5.14, Mt 26.42.
    14. 1 Tm 2.1-2, Jn 17.20, 2 Sm 7.29, Ru 4.12.
    15. 2 Sm 12.21-23, Lk 16.25-26, Rv 14.13; this statement is based on the absence of any command to pray for
    the dead, and of any example in the Scripture of such prayer, 1 Jn 5.14.
    16. 1 Jn 5.16.
    Religious Worship and the Sabbath Day
    37
    5. The ordinary worship of God includes: the reverent and attentive reading of the Scriptures,17 the
    sound preaching18 and conscientious hearing of the word in obedience to God with
    understanding and faith;19 singing of psalms with grace in the heart;20 and the proper
    administration and right receiving of the sacraments instituted by Christ.21 Then there are
    religious oaths22 and vows,23 solemn fasting,24 and thanksgiving on special occasions.25
    Worship should include these at appropriate times, and they should be performed in a holy and
    religious manner.26
    17. Acts 15.21, Rv 1.3, Acts 17.11.
    18. 2 Tm 4.2.
    19. Jas 1.22, Acts 10.33, Mt 13.19, Heb 4.2, Is 66.2.
    20. Col 3.16, Eph 5.19, Jas 5.13, Acts 16.25.
    21. Mt 28.19, 1 Cor 11.23-29, Acts 2.42.
    22. Dt 6.13, Neh 10.29.
    23. Is 19.21, Eccl 5.4-5, Acts 18.18, Ps 116.14, Neh 10.29.
    24. Jl 2.12, Est 4.16, Mt 9.15, 1 Cor 7.5, Mt 6.17-18.
    25. Ps 107, Est 9.22, Neh 12.31-43.
    26. Heb 12.28, Jn 4.24, Heb 10.22.
    6. Under the gospel neither prayer nor any other part of religious worship is tied to or made more
    acceptable by being performed in any particular place.27 God is to be worshiped everywhere28
    in spirit and in truth;29 in private families30 daily;31 privately by individuals daily;32 and
    regularly in solemn public gatherings, which are not to be carelessly or willfully neglected or
    forsaken, since God calls us to join other believers in public worship.33
    27. Jn 4.21.
    28. Mal 1.11, 1 Tm 2.8.
    29. Jn 4.23-24.
    30. Jer 10.25, Dt 6.6-7, Jb 1.5, 2 Sm 6.8-18, 20, 1 Pt 3.7, Acts 10.2.
    31. Mt 6.11, Jos 24.15, Dn 6.10.
    32. Mt 6.6, Eph 6.18, Neh 1.4-11.
    33. Is 56.7, Heb 10.25, Prv 1.20-21, 24, 8.34, Acts 13.42, Lk 4.16, Acts 2.42.
    7. It is a law of our natural, earthly life that some appropriate amount of time be set aside for the
    worship of God. In his word God has similarly commanded all men in every age to keep one
    day in seven holy unto him as a Sabbath.34 From the beginning of the world up to the
    resurrection of Christ, this Sabbath was the last day of the week. Since the resurrection of
    Christ it has been changed to the first day of the week, called the Lord’s day in Scripture, and is
    to be continued until the end of the world as the Christian Sabbath.35
    34. Ex 20.8-11, Is 56.2,4,6-7.
    35. Gn 2.2-3, 1 Cor 16.1-2, Acts 20.7, Rv 1.10, Ex 20.8,10, Mt 5.17-18; these texts are cited in connection with
    the example of the apostles and the early church.
    8. The Sabbath is kept holy unto the Lord when men prepare their hearts for it; arrange for their
    daily affairs to be taken care of beforehand; rest the whole day from their own works and
    words, and from thoughts about their worldly activities and recreations;36 and take up the whole
    time in public and private worship and in the duties of necessity and mercy.37
    36. Ex 20.8, 16.23, 25-26,29-30, 31.15-17, Is 58.13, Neh 13.15-22, Lk 23.56.
    37. Is 58.13, Mt 12.1-13.
    38
    Chapter 22
    Lawful Oaths and Vows
    1. Lawful oaths are part of religious worship.1 On proper occasions believers may solemnly swear
    and call God to witness that what they assert or promise is true, and they may ask God to judge
    them according to the truth or falsehood of what they swear.2
    1. Dt 10.20.
    2. Ex 20.7, Lv 19.12, 2 Cor 1.23, 2 Chr 6.22-23
    2. The name of God is the only name by which men should swear, and that name is to be used
    with holy awe and reverence.3 Therefore to swear vainly or rashly by that glorious and mighty
    name or to swear at all by any other name is sinful and to be abhorred.4 Just as in important
    matters an oath is warranted by the word of God, under the New as well as the Old Testament,
    so a lawful oath, required by legitimate authority in such matters ought to be taken.5
    3. Dt 6.13.
    4. Ex 20.7, Jer 5.7, Mt 5.34,37, Jas 5.12.
    5. Heb 6.16, 2 Cor 1.23, Is 65.16, 1 Kgs 8.31, Neh 13.25, Ezr 10.5, Mt 26.63-64.
    3. Whoever takes an oath ought to consider fully the importance of such a solemn act, and so he
    should swear to nothing but what he is completely convinced is true. No one may bind himself
    by an oath to anything but what is good and just, to what he believes to be true, and to what he
    is able and determined to perform. It is a sin to refuse to swear an oath about anything good and
    just, when it is required by lawful authority.6
    6. Ex 20.7, Jer 4.2, Gn 24.2-3,5-6,8-9, Nm 5.19,21, Neh 5.12, Ex 22.7-11; see citations under Section 2 above.
    4. An oath is to be taken in the plain, ordinary sense of the words used, without any equivocation
    or mental reservation.7 It cannot obligate one to sin; but once taken about anything not sinful, it
    must be performed, even to one’s own harm,8 and must not be broken, even if made to heretics
    or atheists.9
    7. Jer 4.2, Ps 24.4, Ex 20.7.
    8. 1 Sm 25.22, 32-34, Ps 15.4.
    9. Ez 17.16,1 8-19, Jos 9.18-19, 2 Sm 21.1.
    5. A vow is similar to an oath promising something and should be made with similar religious
    care and performed with similar faithfulness.10
    10. Is 19.21, Eccl 5.4-6, Ps 61.8, 66.13-14, Dt 23.21,23.
    6. A vow should be made to no one but God.11 In order to be accepted it should be made
    voluntarily in a faithful and conscientious way as thanks for mercy received or as means of
    getting what we want. A vow binds us more strictly to necessary duties or to other things to
    such an extent and for as long as is appropriate.12
    11. Ps 76.11, Jer 44.25-26.
    12. Dt 23.21,23, Ps 50.14, Gn 28.20-22, 1 Sm 1.11, Ps 66.13-14, 132.2-5.
    Lawful Oaths and Vows
    39
    7. No one may vow to do anything forbidden in the word of God, anything hindering a duty
    commanded in the word, or anything not in his own power, which he has neither the ability nor
    warrant from God to perform.13 In this respect monastic vows of perpetual celibacy, professed
    poverty, and consistent obedience do not perfect us but are actually superstitious, sinful traps,
    in which no Christian should entangle himself.14
    13. Acts 23.12,14, Mk 6.26, Nm 30.5, 8, 12-13.
    14. Mt 19.11-12, 1 Cor 7.2,9, Eph 4.28, 1 Pt 4.2, 1 Cor 7.23, 1 Thes 4.11-12.

    Chapter 23
    Civil Authorities
    1. God, the supreme Lord and King of the whole world, has ordained civil authorities to be over
    people under him for his own glory and the public good. For this purpose he has armed civil
    authorities with the power of the sword to defend and encourage those who are good and to
    punish wrongdoers.1
    1. Rom 13.1-4, 1 Pt 2.13-14
    2. It is lawful for Christians to accept and execute offices of civil authority when that is their
    calling.2 In the administration of such offices they should take care to support true religion,
    justice, and peace, according to the beneficial laws of each government,3 and in so doing they
    may lawfully under the New Testament wage war on just and necessary occasions.4
    2. Prv 8.15-16, Rom 13.1-4; see citations under Section 1 above.
    3. Ps 2.10-12, 1 Tm 2.2, Ps 82.3-4, 2 Sm 23.3, 1 Pt 2.13, Ps 101; see citations under Section 1 above.
    4. Lk 3.14, Rom 13.1-4, Mt 8.9-10, Acts 10.1-2, Rv 17.14,16.
    3. Civil authorities may not take on themselves the ministering of God’s word and the sacraments,
    the administration of spiritual power, or any interference with matters of faith.5 Nevertheless it
    is the duty of civil authorities to protect the church of our Lord, without giving preference to
    any denomination of Christians, so that every person with church affiliations or duties will be
    able to function with complete and unquestioned freedom. Since Jesus Christ has directed the
    establishment of regular government and discipline in his church, no law of any civil
    government should interfere with, abridge, or hinder the proper exercise of church government
    among the voluntary members of Christian denominations, acting in accordance with their own
    professed beliefs. It is the duty of civil authorities to protect the person and good name of
    everyone so that none are abused, injured, or insulted on account of religious faith or lack of it.6
    It is also their duty to see to it that all religious and ecclesiastical assemblies are held without
    disturbance.7
    5. 2 Chr 26.18, Mt 18.17, 16.19, 1 Cor 12.28-29, Eph 4.11-12, 1 Cor 4.1-2, Rom 10.15, Heb 5.4, Jn 18.36,
    Acts 5.29.
    6. Is 49.23, Ps 122.9, Ezr 7.23-28, Lv 24.16, Dt 13.5-6,12, 2 Kgs 18.4, 1 Chr 13.1-9, 2 Kgs 23.1-26, 2 Chr
    34.33, 15.12-13, Rom 13.1-6, Ps 105.15, Acts 18.14-16.
    7. 2 Chr 19.8-11, 29 and 30, Mt 2.4-5, 2 Sm 23.3, Rom 13.4; see General Note.
    Civil Authorities
    41
    4. It is people’s duty to pray for those in authority,8 to honor them,9 to pay them taxes and
    whatever is owed them,10 to obey their lawful commands, and to be subject to them for
    conscience’s sake.11 Unbelief or different religious views on the part of civil authorities does
    not mean that they are to be disobeyed by believers, including clergymen,12 in the legitimate
    pursuit of their duties.13 The Pope, of course, has no power or jurisdiction over civil authorities
    or the people under them in secular affairs. The Pope never has any right to usurp secular
    authority, particularly capital punishment in cases of what is judged to be heresy or any other
    fault.14
    8. 1 Tm 2.1-3.
    9. 1 Pt 2.17.
    10. Rom 13.6-7, Mt 22.21.
    11. Rom 13.5, Ti 3.1.
    12. Rom 13.1, 1 Kgs 2.35, Acts 25.9-11, 2 Pt 2.1, 10-11, Jude 8-11.
    13. 1 Pt 2.13-14, 16; this is an inference from the duties just stated.
    14. 2 Thes 2.4, Rv 13.15-17, 2 Tm 2.24, 1 Pt 5.3; this is an inference from the doctrine of the civil magistrate,
    and from duties incumbent on believers with respect to him.
    42
    Chapter 24
    Marriage and Divorce
    1. Marriage is a union between one man and one woman, designed of God to last so long as they
    both shall live.1
    1. Gn 2.23-24, 1 Cor 7.2,39, Mt 19.4-6, Eph 5.28,31,33, 1 Cor 13.8,13, Mt 5.31-32, Mk 10.5-9, Rom 7.2-3.
    2. Marriage is designed for the mutual help of husband and wife;2 for the safeguarding,
    undergirding, and development of their moral and spiritual character;3 for the propagation of
    children and the rearing of them in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.4
    2. Gn 2.18,24.
    3. Gn 1.27-28, Eph 5.22-23, Col 3.18-19, Gn 2.18-25, 1 Cor 7.3-5, 9, 36.
    4. Gn 1.27-28, 9.1, Mal 2.15, Mt 18.5-6,10,14, 19.14, Eph 6.1-4, Col 3.20-21, Mk 10.13-16, Lk 18.15-17.
    3. All persons who are able with judgment to give their consent may marry,5 except within the
    limits of blood relationship forbidden by Scripture,6 and such marriages are valid before God in
    the eyes of the church.7 But no marriage can be fully and securely Christian in spirit or in
    purpose unless both partners are committed to a common Christian faith and to a deeply shared
    intention of building a Christian home. Evangelical Christians should seek as partners in
    marriage only persons who hold in common a sound basis of evangelical faith.8
    5. Gn 1.27-28.
    6. Mk 6.18, 1 Cor 5.1, Lv 18.6-18.
    7. Mk 1.30, Jn 2.1-2, 1 Tm 5.14, Heb 13.4, 1 Cor 7.7,36, 9.5, 1 Tm 4.3.
    8. 1 Cor 7, esp. v. 39, 2 Cor 6.14-15.
    4. Marriage for the Christian has religious as well as civil significance.9 The distinctive
    contribution of the church in performing the marriage ceremony is to affirm the divine
    institution of marriage;10 to invoke God’s blessing upon those who enter into the marital
    relationship in accordance with his word;11 to hear the vows of those who desire to be married;
    and to assure the married partners of God’s grace within their new relationship.12
    9. Prv 18.22, Mt 19.6, Eph 5.29-30, 32, Mk 10.9, 11-12.
    10. Gn 1.27-28.
    11. Mk 10.9.
    12. Eph 5.22-23.
    5. It is the divine intention that persons entering the marriage covenant become inseparably
    united, thus allowing for no dissolution save that caused by the death of either husband or
    wife.13 However, the weaknesses of one or both partners may lead to gross and persistent denial
    of the marriage vows; yet only in cases of extreme, unrepented-of, and irremediable
    unfaithfulness (physical or spiritual) should separation or divorce be considered. Such
    separation or divorce is accepted as permissible only because of the failure of one or both of the
    partners, and does not lessen in any way the divine intention for indissoluble union.14
    13. Gn 2.23-24, Mt 5.31-32, Mk 10.5-9, Rom 7.2-3, 1 Cor 7.2, 10-11,39, Eph 5.28,31,33, Mt 19.4-9, 1 Cor
    13.4-13.
    14. Mk 10.4-9, 1 Cor 7.12-13, 15, Mt 19.7-9.
    Marriage and Divorce
    43
    6. The remarriage of divorced persons may be sanctioned by the church in keeping with the
    redemptive gospel of Christ, when sufficient penitence for sin and failure is evident, and a firm
    purpose of and endeavor after Christian marriage is manifested.15
    15. 2 Sm 12.13, Neh 9.17, Ps 32.5, 130.4, Mt 12.31a, 21.31-32, Jn 8.3,11, Rom 3.23, Gal 6.1, 1 Tm 2.4, Heb
    7.25, 1 Jn 1.9, 2.1-2, Lk 7.36-50, 15.11-32, Jn 3.16-17, Rom 10.9-10.
    7. Divorced persons should give prayerful thought to discover if God’s vocation for them is to
    remain unmarried, since one failure in this realm raises serious questions as to the rightness and
    wisdom of undertaking another union.16
    16. Mt 5.31-32, 1 Cor 7.10-11, 20, 32-35, Mk 10.11, Lk 16.18.

    Chapter 25
    The Church
    1. The catholic or universal church is invisible and consists of all the elect who have been, are, or
    ever will be gathered into one under Christ, the head. The church is his body and spouse, the
    fullness of God, who fills all in all.1
    1. Eph 1.10, 22-23, 5.23,27,32, Col 1.18.
    2. The visible church is also catholic or universal under the gospel, i.e., it is not confined to one
    nation as previously under the Mosaic Law. It consists of everyone in the world who professes
    the true religion2 together with their children.3 The visible church is the kingdom of the Lord
    Jesus Christ4 and the house and family of God,5 outside of which people cannot ordinarily be
    saved.6
    2 1 Cor 1.2, 12.12-13, Ps 2.8, Rv 7.9, Rom 15.9-12.
    3. 1 Cor 7.14, Acts 2.39, Ez 16.20-21, Rom 11.16, Gn 3.15, 17.7, Gal 3.7,9,14, Rom 4, Mk 10.13-16.
    4. Mt 13.47, Is 9.7, Col 1.13, Mt 13.31, Ps 72.
    5. Eph 2.19, 3.15, Prv 29.18.
    6. Acts 2.47, Mt 28.19, Acts 2.38, 1 Cor 12.13, Mt 26.26-28,10.32-33.
    3. In order to gather and perfect the saints in this life until the end of the world Christ has given
    the ministry, Scriptures, and ordinances of God to this universal visible church, and by his own
    presence and Spirit he enables the church to function in this way according to his promise.7
    7. 1 Cor 12.23, Eph 4.11-13, Mt 28.19-20, Is 59.21.
    4. This universal church has been sometimes more and sometimes less visible.8 Particular
    churches, which are members of it, are also more or less pure, depending on how the gospel is
    accepted and taught, how the ordinances of God are administered, and how public worship is
    performed.9
    8. Rom 11.3-4, Rv 12.6,14, Acts 9.31.
    9. Rv 2 and 3, 1 Cor 5.6-7, Acts 2.41-42.
    5. The purest churches under heaven are subject both to impurity and error.10 Some churches have
    so degenerated that they are not churches of Christ, but synagogues of Satan.11 Nevertheless,
    there will always be a church on earth to worship God according to his will.12

    Chapter 26
    The Fellowship of the Saints
    1. All believers are united to Jesus Christ, their head, by his Spirit and by faith, and have
    fellowship with him in his grace, suffering, death, resurrection, and glory.1 United to one
    another in love the saints have fellowship in each other’s gifts and grace2 and are obliged to
    perform those public and private duties which nourish their mutual good, both spiritually and
    physically.3
    1. 1 Jn 1.3, Eph 3.16-19, Jn 1.16, Eph 2.5-6, Phil 3.10, Rom 6.5-6, 2 Tm 2.12, Rom 8.17.
    2. Eph 4.15-16, 1 Cor 12.7, 3.21-23, Col 2.19, 1 Jn 1.3,7.
    3. 1 Thes 5.11,14, Rom 1.11-12, 14, 1 Jn 3.16-18, Gal 6.10.
    2. By their profession of faith saints are bound to maintain a holy fellowship and communion with
    each other in the worship of God and in the performance of other spiritual services for their
    mutual improvement.4 They are also bound to help each other in material things according to
    their different abilities and needs. This fellowship is to be offered, as God gives the
    opportunity, to everyone in every place who calls on the name of the Lord Jesus.5
    4. Heb 10.24-25, Acts 2.42,46, Is 2.3, 1 Cor 11.20.
    5. Acts 2.44-45, 1 Jn 3.17, 2 Cor 8 and 9, Acts 11.29-30.
    3. This communion which the saints have with Christ in no way means that they share in his
    godhead or are equal with him in any respect—to affirm either is impious and blasphemous.6
    Neither does their communion with each other take away or infringe the right each person has
    to own and possess goods and property.7
    6. Col 1.18-19, 1 Cor 8.6, Is 42.8, 1 Tm 6.15-16, Ps 45.7, Heb 1.8-9, Ps 14.7.

    Chapter 27
    The Sacraments
    1. Sacraments are holy signs and seals of the covenant of grace. They were instituted by God
    along with that covenant1 to represent Christ and his benefits, to confirm our position with and
    in him,2 to demonstrate a visible difference between those who belong to the church and the
    rest of the world,3 and solemnly to engage believers in the service of God in Christ according to
    his word.4
    1. Rom 4.11, Gn 17.7, 9-11, Mt 28.19, 1 Cor 11.23, Ex 13.9-10, 12.3-20.
    2. 1 Cor 10.16, 11.25-26, Gal 3.27.
    3. Rom 15.8, Ex 12.48, Gn 34.14, 1 Cor 10.21, Heb 13.10, 1 Cor 11.27-29.
    4. Rom 6.3-4, 1 Cor 10.2, 14-16, 21; see context.
    2. In every sacrament there is a spiritual relationship or sacramental union between the sign and
    the thing signified. And so the names and effects of the one are attributed to the other.5
    5. Gn 17.10, Mt 26.27-28, Ti 3.5.
    3. The grace revealed in or by sacraments in their right use does not come from any power in
    them. Neither does the effectiveness of a sacrament depend on the devoutness or the intention
    of whoever administers it. Rather the power and effectiveness of the sacraments are the result
    of the work of the Spirit6 and rest on God’s word instituting them, since his word authorizes
    their use and promises benefits to worthy receivers of them.7
    6. Rom 2.28-29, 1 Pt 3.21, Mt 3.11, 1 Cor 12.13, 3.7, 6.11, Jn 3.5, Acts 8.13-23.
    7. Mt 26.27-28, 28.19-20, Jn 6.63, Lk 22.19-20, 1 Cor 11.26.
    4. There are only two sacraments ordained by Christ our Lord in the gospel: baptism and the
    Lord’s supper.8 Ordinarily, neither of these may be administered by anyone but a lawfully
    ordained minister of the word.9
    8. Mt 28.19, 1 Cor 11.20,23, 4.1, Heb 5.4.
    9. See General Note.
    5. The sacraments of the Old Testament signify and reveal in substance the same spiritual things
    as those of the New.10
    10. 1 Cor 10.1-4, 5.7-8, Col 2.11-12.
    47
    Chapter 28
    Baptism
    1. Baptism is a sacrament of the New Testament, ordained by Jesus Christ.1 By baptism a person
    is solemnly admitted into the visible church.2 Baptism is also a sign and seal of the covenant of
    grace,3 of the believer’s engrafting into Christ,4 of rebirth,5 of remission of sins,6 and of the
    believer’s yielding to God through Jesus Christ to walk in newness of life.7 By Christ’s own
    direction this sacrament is to be continued in his church until the end of the world.8
    1. Mt 28.19, Mk 16.16.
    2. 1 Cor 12.13, Gal 3.27-28, Acts 2.41, 10.47.
    3. Rom 4.11, Col 2.11-12, Gal 3.29.
    4. Gal 3.27, Rom 6.3-5.
    5. Ti 3.5.
    6. Mk 1.4, Acts 2.38, 22.16.
    7. Rom 6.3-4.
    8. Mt 28.19-20.
    2. The physical substance to be used in this sacrament is water. The person is to be baptized in the
    name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit9 ordinarily by a lawfully called minister of the
    gospel.10
    9. Mt 3.11, Jn 1.33, Mt 28.19-20, Acts 8.36,38, 10.47, Eph 4.11-13.
    10. See General Note.
    3. Dipping the person into the water is not necessary. Baptism is correctly administered by
    pouring or sprinkling water on the person.11
    11. Heb 9.10,19-22, Acts 2.41, 16.33, Mk 7.4, Acts 1.5, 2.3-4,17, 11.15-16, 10.46-47, 1 Cor 10.2.
    4. Not only those who actually profess faith in and obedience to Christ are to be baptized12 but
    also the infants of one or both believing parents.13
    12. Mk 16.15-16, Acts 8.37-38; see citations under Section 1 above, Acts 9.18.
    13. Gn 17.7,9-10, Gal 3.9,14, Col 2.11-12, Acts 2.38-39, Rom 4.11-12, 1 Cor 7.14, Mt 28.19, Mk 10.13-16, Lk
    18.15-16, Acts 16.14-15,33.
    5. Although it is a great sin to condemn or neglect this sacrament,14 baptism is not inseparably
    connected with God’s grace and salvation. One can be saved and reborn without baptism,15 and,
    on the other hand, everyone who is baptized is not therefore unquestionably reborn.16
    14. Lk 7.30, Ex 4.24-26, Gn 17.14, Dt 28.9.
    15. Rom 4.11, Acts 10.2, 4, 22, 31, 45-47, Lk 23.40-43.
    16. Acts 8.13,23.
    6. The effectiveness of baptism is not tied to that moment in time in which it is administered.17
    However, by the correct use of this sacrament the grace promised in it is not only offered but
    actually embodied and conferred by the Holy Spirit to everyone (adult or infant) to whom that
    grace is given, according to the purpose of God’s own will and in his appointed time.18
    17. Jn 3.5,8, Rom 4.11.
    18. Gal 3.27, Ti 3.5, Eph 5.25-26, Acts 2.38-41, Eph 1.4-5, Acts 16.31,33.
    7. The sacrament of baptism should be administered only once to a person.19
    19. Ti 3.5; there is no command, and no adequate example for the repetition of baptism.
    48
    Chapter 29
    The Lord’s Supper
    1. The night Jesus was betrayed he instituted the sacrament of his body and blood, called the
    Lord’s supper, to be observed in his church until the end of the world as a perpetual
    remembrance of his sacrifice in death and as the seal of all the benefits of that sacrifice for true
    believers. It also signifies the spiritual nourishment and growth of believers in Jesus and their
    additional commitment to perform all the duties they owe him. Finally it is a bond and pledge
    of believers’ communion with Jesus and with each other as members of his mystical body.1
    1. 1 Cor 11.23-26, 10.16-17, 21, 12.13, Mt 26.26-27, Lk 22.19-20.
    2. In this sacrament Christ is not offered up to his Father, nor is any actual sacrifice made for the
    remission of sins of the living or the dead.2 Rather, this sacrament commemorates Christ’s
    offering up of himself, by himself, on the cross once for all, and it spiritually offers up to God
    every possible praise for that sacrifice.3 Consequently the so-called sacrifice of the Roman
    Catholic mass does detestable injustice to Christ’s one sacrifice, which is the only propitiation
    for all the sins of the elect.4
    2. Heb 9.22, 25-26, 28.
    3. 1 Cor 11.24-26, Mt 26.26-27, Lk 22.19-20.
    4. Heb 7.23-24, 27, 10.11-12, 14, 18.
    3. In the administration of the Lord’s supper Jesus has directed his ministers to declare to the
    congregation his words instituting this sacrament, to pray, and to bless the bread and wine,
    which are thus set apart from their ordinary use and put to holy use. His ministers are to take
    and break the bread, to take the cup, and (communicating themselves, too) to give both to the
    communicants—but not to anyone else not present at that time in the congregation.5
    5. Mt 26.26-28, Mk 14.22-24, Lk 22.19-20, 1 Cor 11.23-27; see citations under Sections 1 and 2, Acts 20.7, 1
    Cor 11.20.
    4. Practices contrary to the nature of this sacrament and to the institution of it by Christ are private
    masses or receiving the sacrament alone from a priest or anyone else;6 denying the cup to the
    congregation;7 and worshiping the bread and wine themselves by lifting them up or carrying
    them around for adoration or reserving them for any counterfeit religious use.8
    6. 1 Cor 10.6, 1 Tm 1.3-4.
    7. Mk 4.23, 1 Cor 11.25-29.
    8. Mt 15.9; there is not the least appearance of a warrant for any of these things, either in precept or example,
    in any part of the word of God; see all the places in which the ordinance is mentioned.
    5. The bread and wine in this sacrament, properly set apart to the uses ordained by Christ, so relate
    to him crucified that truly and yet only sacramentally they are sometimes called by the name of
    what they represent, that is, the body and blood of Christ.9 Even so, they still remain in
    substance and nature only bread and wine, as they were before their sacramental use.10
    9. Mt 26.26-28.
    10. 1 Cor 11.26-28, Mt 26.29.
    6. The teaching that the substance of the bread and wine is changed into the substance of Christ’s
    body and blood (usually called transubstantiation) by the consecration of a priest or any other
    means is objectionable not only to Scripture but even to common sense and reason. Such
    The Lord’s Supper
    49
    teaching overturns the nature of the sacrament and has been and is the cause of much
    superstition and indeed flagrant idolatry.11
    11. Acts 3.21, 1 Cor 11.24-26, Lk 24.6, 39; these statements are inferences from the doctrine of the sacraments
    and do not require specific Scripture proofs.
    7. Worthy receivers, physically partaking of the visible substances of this sacrament, do then also
    by faith actually and in fact, but not physically or bodily, spiritually receive and feed on Christ
    crucified and on all the benefits of his death. The body and blood of Christ are not then bodily
    or physically in, with, or under the bread and wine; but they are actually spiritually present to
    the faith of believers in the administration of this sacrament, just as the bread and wine are
    physically present.12
    12. 1 Cor 11.28, 5.7-8, 10.16,3-4, Jn 6.53,58; see note under Section 6 above.
    8. Although ignorant or wicked men may partake of the physical substances in this sacrament,
    they do not receive what is signified by them. However, by their unworthy coming to the
    Lord’s table they are guilty of his body and blood and bring judgment upon themselves.
    Therefore, just as the ignorant and ungodly are not fit to enjoy communion with Christ, neither
    are they worthy to come to the Lord’s table, and, as long as they remain ignorant and ungodly,
    they cannot and must not be allowed to partake of the holy mystery of communion without
    committing a great sin against Christ.13
    13. 1 Cor 11.27-29, 2 Cor 6.14-16, 1 Cor 10.21, 5.6-7,13, 2 Thes 3.6,14-15, Mt 7.6.
    50
    Chapter 30
    Condemnation by the Church
    1. As king and head of his church, the Lord Jesus has directed the establishment of church
    government, separate from civil authority, which is to be administered by officers of the
    church.1
    1. Is 9.6-7, 1 Tm 5.17, 1 Thes 5.12, Acts 20.17,28, Heb 13.7,17,24, 1 Cor 12.28, Mt 28.18-20, Ps 2.6-9, Jn
    18.36.
    2. To these officers are committed the keys of the kingdom of heaven, which empower them to
    free people from the guilt of sin or to bind them to it; to close the kingdom of heaven to the
    unrepentant by the word and condemnation; and to open the kingdom to repentant sinners by
    the ministry of the gospel and by withdrawing condemnation as the occasion demands.2
    2. Mt 16.19, 18.17-18, Jn 20.21-23, 2 Cor 2.6-8.
    3. Condemnation by the church is necessary in order to reclaim and regain spiritual brothers who
    have committed some serious offense; to deter others from committing similar offenses; to
    purge that leaven which might contaminate the whole lump; to vindicate the honor of Christ
    and the holy profession of the gospel; and to avoid the wrath of God, which might justly fall on
    the church, should it allow his covenant and the sacraments to be profaned by notorious and
    obstinate offenders.3
    3. 1 Cor 5, 1 Tm 5.20, Mt 7.6, 1 Tm 1.20, 1 Cor 11.27-34, Jude 23, 2 Sm 12.14.
    4. The best way to accomplish these purposes is for the officers of the church to act in accordance
    with the severity of the offense and the guilt of the offender by warning the offender, excluding
    him from the sacrament of the Lord’s supper for a time, or excommunicating him from the
    church.4
    4. 1 Thes 5.12, 2 Thes 3.6,14-15, 1 Cor 5.4-5,13, Mt 18.17, Ti 3.10.
    51
    Chapter 31
    Synods and Councils
    1. The assemblies which are generally called synods or councils ought to be held for the better
    government and continuing improvement of the church. By virtue of their office and the power
    Christ has given them to build up and not destroy, the leaders of particular churches should
    arrange for such assemblies and meet together in them as often as is judged necessary for the
    good of the church. 1
    1. Acts 15.1-41, Rv 2.1-6, Acts 20.17,28, Is 49.23, 1 Tm 2.1-2, 2 Chr 19.8-11, 29-30, Mt 2.4-5, Prv 11.14,
    Acts 15, 20.17.
    2. As far as the ministry is concerned, it is the responsibility of synods and councils to settle
    controversies of faith and cases relating to matters of conscience, to set down rules and
    directions for the better administration of the public worship of God and of church government,
    and to hear complaints in cases of maladministration and authoritatively to settle them. If these
    decisions conform to the word of God, they are to be accepted reverently and submissively, not
    only because they agree with the word but also because they rest on authority ordained and
    arranged by God in his word.2
    2. Acts 15.15,19,24,27-31, 16.4, Mt 18.17-20,29.
    3. Since apostolic times all synods and councils, whether general or local, may make mistakes,
    and many have. Consequently synods and councils are not to be made a final authority in
    questions of faith and living but are to be used as an aid to both.3
    3. Eph 2.20, Acts 17.11, 1 Cor 2.5, 2 Cor 1.24; see General Note.
    4. Synods and councils should consider and settle only ecclesiastical questions. They are not to
    meddle in civil affairs which concern the state except in extraordinary cases of modest petitions
    or in an advisory capacity prompted by religious conscience, when requested by civil
    authorities.4
    4. Lk 12.13-14, Jn 18.36, Mt 22.21.
    52
    Chapter 32
    The Condition of Man after Death and the Resurrection of the Dead
    1. After death the bodies of human beings decompose and return to dust,1 but their souls, which
    do not die or sleep, have an immortal existence and immediately return to God who created
    them.2 The souls of the righteous are then perfected in holiness and are received into the highest
    heavens, where they behold the face of God in light and glory and wait for the full redemption
    of their bodies.3 The souls of the wicked are thrown into hell, where they remain in torment and
    complete darkness, set apart for the great day of judgment.4 Scripture recognizes only these two
    places, and no other, for souls separated from their bodies.
    1. Gn 3.19, Acts 13.36.
    2. Lk 23.43, Eccl 12.7, Phil 1.23, 2 Cor 5.6-8.
    3. Heb 12.23, 2 Cor 5.1,6,8, Phil 1.23, Acts 3.21, Eph 4.10, 1 Jn 3.2, Lk 16.23, Rom 8.23; see under figure 2
    above, Rv 7.4,15.
    4. Lk 16.23-24, Acts 1.25, Jude 6-7, 1 Pt 3.19, 2 Pt 2.9.
    2. Those who are alive at the last day will not die but will be changed.5 At that time all the dead
    will be raised with the very same bodies and no other than the same bodies they had before,
    although with different characteristics, which will be united again to their souls forever.6
    5. 1 Thes 4.17, 1 Cor 15.51-52.
    6. Jb 19.26-27, 1 Cor 15.42-44; see preceding context.
    3. By the power of Christ the bodies of the unjust shall be raised to dishonor, but by his Spirit the
    bodies of the just will be raised to honor and be made according to the pattern of his own
    glorious body.7
    7. Acts 24.15, Jn 5.28-29, 1 Cor 15.42, Phil 3.21.
    53
    Chapter 33
    The Last Judgment
    1. God the Father has ordained a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by Jesus
    Christ,1 to whom he has given all power and judgment.2 In that day not only will the apostate
    angels be judged, but all the people who have lived on earth will appear before the court of
    Christ to give an account of their thoughts, words, and actions, and be judged according to what
    they have done in the body, whether good or evil.3
    1. Acts 17.31, Mt 25.31-34.
    2. Jn 5.22,27.
    3. 1 Cor 6.3, Jude 6, 2 Pt 2.4, 2 Cor 5.10, Eccl 12.14, Rom 2.16, 14.10,12, Mt 12.36-37, 1 Cor 3.13-15.
    2. God’s purpose in arranging for this day is to show forth the glory of his mercy in the eternal
    salvation of the elect4 and the glory of his justice in the damnation of the reprobate, who are
    wicked and disobedient.5 At that time the righteous will go into everlasting life and receive that
    fullness of joy and refreshment which will come from the presence of the Lord.6 But the
    wicked, who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of Jesus Christ, will be thrown into
    eternal torment and punished with everlasting destruction away from the presence of the Lord
    and the glory of his power.7
    4. Rom 9.23, Mt 25.21, Eph 2.4-7.

    7. Mt 25.41,46, 2 Thes 1.9, Is 66.24, Mk 9.47-48.
    3. Christ wants us to be completely convinced that there is going to be a day of judgment, as a
    deterrent to sin for everyone and as an added consolation for the godly in their suffering.8 He
    has also made sure that no one knows when that day will be, so that we may never rest secure
    in our worldly surroundings, but, not knowing what hour the Lord will come, we must always
    be alert and may always be ready to say, “Come, Lord Jesus, come quickly.”9 Amen.

    Chapter 34
    The Holy Spirit
    1. The Holy Spirit, the third person in the Trinity, proceeding from the Father and the Son, of the
    same substance and equal in power and glory, is, together with the Father and the Son, to be
    believed in, loved, obeyed, and worshiped throughout all ages.
    2 Cor 13.14, Jn 15.26, Mt 28.19, 3.16-17, Lk 1.35, Eph 4.30, Heb 10.29, 1 Cor 10.10-11, Rv 22.17, Eph 2.18-
    20,22, Jn 14.26, 16.7, Gal 4.4-6, Acts 5.3-4, 16.6-7, Mk 3.29, Rom 8.26-27, 1 Jn 2.20-27, Acts 2.33, Jn 20.22,
    Rom 8.14, 1 Thes 5.19, Jn 4.24.
    2. He is the Lord and giver of life, everywhere present, and is the source of all good thoughts,
    pure desires, and holy counsels in men. By him the prophets were moved to speak the word of
    God, and all the writers of the Holy Scriptures inspired to record infallibly the mind and will of
    God. The dispensation of the gospel is especially committed to him. He prepares the way for it,
    accompanies it with his persuasive power, and urges its message upon the reason and
    conscience of men, so that they who reject its merciful offer are not only without excuse, but
    are also guilty of resisting the Holy Spirit.
    Eph 4.30, 5.9, Gn 1.2, Jn 3.5,7, Acts 2.1-21, Gal 5.22-25, Jn 16.8-11, 2 Pt 1.21, 2 Tm 3.16, 1 Cor 2.9-10,13, 1

    Rom 5.5, Mt 12.31-32.
    3. The Holy Spirit, whom the Father is ever willing to give to all who ask him, is the only efficient
    agent in the application of redemption. He regenerates men by his grace, convicts them of sin,
    moves them to repentance, and persuades and enables them to embrace Jesus Christ by faith.
    He unites all believers to Christ, dwells in them as their comforter and sanctifier, gives to them
    the spirit of adoption and prayer, and performs all these gracious offices by which they are
    sanctified and sealed unto the day of redemption.
    Jn 3.1-8, Acts 2.38, Lk 11.13, 1 Cor 12.3, Jn 7.37-39, 16.13, 16.7-11, Rv 22.17, Ti 3.5-7, 2 Thes 2.13, Gal 4.6, 1

    21, Rom 15.16, Heb 10.14-15, 1 Cor 6.19, 3.16.
    4. By the indwelling of the Holy Spirit all believers being vitally united to Christ, who is the head,
    are thus united one to another in the church, which is his body. He calls and anoints ministers
    for their holy office, qualifies all other officers in the church for their special work, and imparts
    various gifts and graces to its members. He gives efficacy to the word and to the ordinances of
    the gospel. By him the church will be preserved, increased, purified, and at last made perfectly
    holy in the presence of God.

    Chapter 35
    The Gospel of the Love of God and Missions
    1. God in infinite and perfect love, having provided in the covenant of grace, through the
    mediation and sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ, a way of life and salvation, sufficient for and
    adapted to the whole lost race of man, freely offers this salvation to all men in the gospel.
    Rv 22.17, Jn 3.16, 1 Jn 2.1-2, Acts 2.38-39, Mt 11.28-30, 2 Cor 5.14-19, Ti 2.11, Heb 2.9, Lk 24.46-47, Jer
    31.3, 1 Jn 4.9,16, Ti 3.4-5. Heb 13.20-21, 12.22-24, 8.10, Eph 2.8, 1 Tm 2.5-6, Heb 9.26, 1 Cor 15.3, Rom
    5.6,8, Jn 10.10-11, 11.25, 14.6,19, Phil 1.21, Acts 4.12, Rom 1.16, Heb 5.9, 2 Pt 3.9, Mt 24.14, Jn 4.42, Rv
    11.15, Rom 6.23, 2 Cor 9.15.
    2. In the gospel God declares his love for the world and his desire that all men should be saved;
    reveals fully and clearly the only way of salvation; promises eternal life to all who truly repent
    and believe in Christ; invites and commands all to embrace the offered mercy; and by his Spirit
    accompanying the word pleads with men to accept his gracious invitation.
    Mt 28.19-20, Acts 4.12, Jn 6.37-40, 17.3, Acts 16.30-31, 2.38, Gal 2.16-20, Rom 1.16-17, 4.5, Acts 13.38-
    39,48, 2 Pt 3.9, Mt 11.28-30, Mk 1.14-15, Acts 17.30, Rv 22.17, Ez 33.11, Is 1.18, Lk 13.34, Jn 3.16-17, 1 Jn
    4.9-10, Is 45.22, Heb 10.19-22, Jn 14.6, Rom 10.9, 1 Pt 1.8-9, Heb 3.7-8, 2 Cor 6.2, Heb 4.16, Rom 5.8, 2 Thes
    3.5, Phil 2.12-13, Jn 16.13-14.
    3. It is the duty and privilege of everyone who hears the gospel immediately to accept its merciful
    provisions; and they who continue in impenitence and unbelief incur aggravated guilt and
    perish by their own fault.
    Heb 2.3, 12.25, Acts 13.46, Mt 10.32-33, Lk 12.47-48, Heb 10.29, 1 Thes 5.9-10, Jn 1.12, Heb 4.16, Rv 22.17,
    1 Tm 6.12, Jn 3.18, Mt 25.46, Rom 6.23.
    4. Since there is no other way of salvation than that revealed in the gospel, and since in the
    divinely established and ordinary method of grace faith comes by hearing the word of God,
    Christ has commissioned his church to go into all the world and to make disciples of all
    nations. All believers are, therefore, under obligation to sustain the ordinances of the Christian
    religion where they are already established, and to contribute by their prayers, gifts, and
    personal efforts to the extension of the kingdom of Christ throughout the whole earth.
    Acts 4.12, Mt 28.19-20, Acts 1.8, Rom 10.13-17, Heb 10.19-25, Gal 3.28, 1 Cor 16.1-2, Mt 9.36-38, Acts 13.2-

    Afterword on the Texts
    The major changes made by American Presbyterians to the Westminster Confession in 1788
    concerned statements about the relationship between the church and the civil government in Chapters
    23 and 31. The original Confession of 1647 allows some secular authority over and interference in
    church affairs, which the American Presbyterians were unwilling to grant.
    After the great division of the church into the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America
    (PCUSA) and the Presbyterian Church in the United States (PCUS) at the conclusion of the Civil
    War, both PCUSA and PCUS wrote new chapters on marriage. The Evangelical Presbyterian Church
    has adopted what was the PCUS version of Chapter 24.
    The EPC has also adopted the new, American Chapters 34 and 35. These were added by PCUSA in
    1903, and subsequently by PCUS and the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church. The original
    wording of these two chapters included deliberately archaic expressions (“doth,” “hath,” etc.), which
    have been modernized here.
    The EPC has amended the Confession at three points. The word “ordinarily” has been added to
    Chapter 27, Section 4, and to Chapter 28, Section 2. The phrase, “so that the marriage dies at the heart
    and the union becomes,” has been deleted from the second sentence of Section 5 of Chapter 24. For
    the Larger Catechism, “only” has been replaced with “ordinarily” in A 176.
    The editors are: Dr. Philip Rollinson, Emeritus Professor of English at the University of South
    Carolina, Columbia, and Dr. Douglas F. Kelly, Jordon Professor of Systematic Theology at Reformed
    Theological Seminary, Charlotte, NC. They have been joined by Dr. Hugh W. McClure, III, a retired
    Presbyterian minister, for the Confession, and by Dr. S. Donald Fortson, III, Assistant Professor of
    Church History and Practical Theology at Reformed Theological Seminary, Charlotte, NC, for the
    Larger Catechism.
    For the Shorter Catechism, Drs. Kelly and Rollinson were joined by a translation team from the
    Westshor Group of Jackson, Mississippi: Rev. Frederick T. Marsh, Thomas I. Rice, III, A. Jerry
    Sheldon, Dr. Luder G. Whitlock, Jr., and Rev. William K. Wymond. The Westshor Group was
    comprised of a group of lay members of First Presbyterian Church in Jackson, Mississippi, who
    conceived of modernizing the Shorter Catechism in the 1980s after the example of the modern
    language Confession of Faith and who subsidized the project.
